1gh67lq,November Banner: World Children's Day,McClanky,2024-11-01 14:06:08+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gh67lq/november_banner_world_childrens_day/,6,/r/Christianity/comments/1gh67lq/november_banner_world_childrens_day/,Christianity,"This month’s banner is in celebration of World Children’s Day on November 20^(th).

>November 20th is an important date as it is the date in 1959 when the UN General Assembly adopted the [Declaration of the Rights of the Child](http://undocs.org/A/RES/1386%20(XIV)). It is also the date in 1989 when the UN General Assembly adopted the [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://undocs.org/A/RES/44/25).

Read the Convention on the Rights of the Child here:

[https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/convention-text](https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/convention-text)

[https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-childrens-day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-childrens-day)

A verse that stands out to me that I feel speaks directly to the heart of this day is Mark 10:13-16

>People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.

While the verse itself seems to be more aimed at brining children to Christianity, the notion that children are individuals who deserve their own voice is shown here as it is in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Adults tend to think that only we know what is best for children. In some aspects, there is truth to that, but we tend to go too far in ""knowing"" what is right for them that we strip away their unique identity as a person.

The goal of celebrating World Children’s Day is to bring to light the notion that children have rights too. The welfare and well-being of children is as important as that of adults despite children feeling like the property of their parents rather than unique individuals.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most ratified human rights treaty in history. As of right now, the United States is the only UN Nation that has not ratified this treaty, although it played a major role in its drafting.

One of the main reason the United States remain unique in this regard is due to Conservative Christian institutions like the Heritage Foundation as well as the Home School Legal Defense Association. Both Christian organizations believe ratifying this treaty would harm the traditional family with the Heritage Foundation stating, “a civil society in which moral authority is exercised by religious congregations, family, and other private associations is fundamental to the American order.”

The Convention’s main principle is that children have the right to a unique life. This means that children should be afforded the best education and healthcare as possible while giving parents the means to help their child grow.

>States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.

Institutions like the Heritage Foundation, as well as other Conservative Christian institutions see this kind of thing as an afront to what they hold most dear:

>**De-emphasize** the role of mothers and increase incentives for them to work rather than stay home to care for children.

>**Reduce** parental authority while expanding children's rights.

>**Encourage** governments to change religious rules and customs that impede its efforts.

Now, the Bible doesn't seem to necessarily agree outright with what is discussed in the Convention since the culture around when Scripture was written thought not sparing the rod was a better means to raise a “submissive” child then to give them the freedom to grow; however, we have come to understand through time that the concepts written in the Convention give way to children capable of growing emotionally as well as intellectually and physically, creating a more well-rounded person.

Allowing children to gain emotional intelligence, self-esteem, and self-identity help foster adults who have less issues with stress, anxiety, and depression.

[https://afrikindness.org/building-mental-health-the-importance-of-self-expression-in-children/](https://afrikindness.org/building-mental-health-the-importance-of-self-expression-in-children/)

Like many social issues right now, a lot of this comes back to queer identity, especially queer identity of children.

This Convention would allow children to have more freedoms to outwardly express their inward feeling, which either scares a lot of Conservative Christian institutions or gives Conservative Christian institutions a means to create outrage for personal gain.

This month, I challenge you to think about the goals of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and how Christianity, Christians, and Christian institutions should approach such a thing. A push for the US to ratify this treaty comes up in Congress every now and then, so US citizens have a unique means to push their representatives to agree, or disagree, with ratifying this treaty the next time it is presented.",2,True,Meta,meta,0.88,False,Meta

[Candace Fails holds a photograph of her daughter Nevaeh Crain, who died last year after seeking help from two hospitals for pregnancy complications.](https://preview.redd.it/dynh8bgtdbyd1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bfe88fdbcf0e90114e760dca04c32e46e29b3bf)

I've heard/seen the talking points: ""this is because of incompetency on the doctors' part"". The problem is that the laws are very vague when it comes to any kind of ""exception"". They leave it up to the healthcare workers to decide if they want to risk imprisonment or at least losing their medical license because some no-nothing politicians and lawyers decide to interpret the law differently or that they don't believe it was medically necessary. So the doctors are forced to wait until there is no fetal heartbeat before doing anything.

I'm tired of seeing Christians make excuses for a very bad man because ""I'm pro-life and can't vote for murdering babies"". This isn't pro-life. This is pro-death. And the more stories like this that are out there, the more it proves that this was never about saving life - it was always about controlling women.

EDIT: I think it might be helpful if I tell you my story: I used to be in the ""Pro Life"" camp. I used to march around abortion clinics with signs. Then, things started to change for me. A lot of opinions I had fell like dominoes.

The first step, for me, was that I decided I wasn't going to be a one issue voter any more. I decided that I wasn't going to let the Republican party manipulate me into ignoring everything else they did that was the opposite of ""Pro Life"" just because of abortion. This happened around the end of George W.'s presidency, and I'd started to doubt the justification of the Iraq war. I decided that getting out of Iraq was an important issue for me, and that this was a ""Pro Life"" issue for me. And I thought to myself: the Republican party always runs on this idea of ""we're the Pro Life party"", and they not only had the presidency, but for a bit there they had everything else too. And yet they didn't make abortion illegal. So either they didn't intend to, or they lied about being able to. Either way, it's not going to be the only issue I vote for any more.

Then came Obama's reelection. At that point I felt I had to go and listen to what liberal Christians actually have to say about issues like this. And I discovered, lo and behold, that abortion rates are always DOWN under liberal presidents and UP under conservative presidents. Your restrictive policies don't stop abortion - they just stop SAFE abortion. Women resort to back-alley clinics and home remedies when you've outlawed abortion, and there ends up being more death. Why are they so desperate?

Turns out there was a massive study done by scientists from the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Guttmacher Institute in New York, a reproductive rights group. It found that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not. The one factor that this study found made a difference - how good the healthcare and other related social safety nets were in the country. So countries like England - where they not only have free healthcare, but they subsidize child care, as well as a number of other services for single mothers (they'll actually do her laundry) - have a much lower rate of abortion than America, where we call all of that ""socialism"" or ""communism"" and demonize it. And guess who are the ones demonizing those kinds of services? The ""Pro Life"" people. You're not only against safe abortion, but you're against anything that would actually help mothers who are so terrified of financial ruin that they'd abort their ""children"".

I put that word in quotes because of the last step for me. The last step is when I started thinking about the difference between killing and murder. See, most ""Pro Lifers"" are also the type of people who enjoy a nice hamburger, a BBQ sandwich, or a bucket of chicken. There is a difference in their mind between ""murder"" and killing a cow, pig, or chicken. But when you press them on what that difference is, it all comes down to magical thinking. I started thinking about this a lot more when I read [this story about a mother whose baby was born without a brain, and she wishes she could have had a late term abortion](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/late-term-abortion-rape_n_5c630b8de4b0a8731aeabbd6). It made no sense to me to think of an abortion in this scenario as ""murder"", because it literally didn't have a brain - therefore, it's not possible for it to have had consciousness in any form.

Legally and medically, the difference between ""murder"" and ""not murder"" in the scenario where you ""pull the plug"" comes down to brain wave patterns - if you have a certain brain wave pattern, it would be murder. If you don't, that means your brain is damaged beyond repair and you'll never be conscious again - so, not murder.

A clump of cells does not have a brain. If a woman wants to abort it for any reason, it's really none of my business. Personally I wouldn't - but it's not my body.",314,True,News,news,0.86,False,News

Matthew‬ ‭5‬:‭28‬
28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

1 Corinthians 10:13
13  No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

1 John 2:16
16  For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.

1 Peter 2:11
11  Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.

1 Corinthians 6:18
18  Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.

2 Timothy 2:22
22  Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

Galatians 5:16
16  So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.

Romans 8:6
6  The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.

Romans 13:14
14  Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.

Genesis 38:9-10
9  But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.
10  What he did was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so the LORD put him to death also.

James 1:13-14
13  When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
14  but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.

Galatians 5:19-21
19  The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
20  idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions
21  and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

1 Corinthians 7:3-5
3  The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
4  The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife.
5  Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

1 Thessalonians 4:3-5
3  It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;
4  that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
5  not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;

Matthew 5:27-30
27  “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’
28  But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
29  If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
30  And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

You were not born that way. There are many who have been set free from that lifestyle - the same way no one is born a drunkard. It’s just the effect of living in a fallen World. Giving it up for Jesus is the best decision you can make. ❤️

I fully expect to now see a bunch of posts from people who get their history from TikTok make wild, unhistoric claims about how Christmas is somehow pagan.

I’ve been thinking quite a bit recently about religion in an abstract, generalized way. I’ve come to a few conclusions. One is that I believe that religion, or at least faith in a higher power, is an integral part of the human experience. I do not believe that this is affected by how developed or advanced a society is as Nietzsche posited. It has always been a part of who we are, and while it may take on different forms in the future, it will always be with us.

Another conclusion I’ve come to is that religion serves a number of practically purposes. It gives us a metaphysical explanation for existence and purpose, it provides a moral framework, it gives comfort in times of distress, and it creates a shared identity via shared beliefs and practices.

This is where it goes back to the holiday thing. It seems to me that a big part of the fundamentalist ideology is a rejection of the traditional practices and factual history of Christianity. This unmoors the identity and leaves it adrift in a sea of personal whims.

Additionally, it changes the approach to the moral framework. Instead of using religion as a set of values to strive for and judging each action on whether it works for or against these values, it creates a list of prohibited activities. The justification for these prohibitions comes down to “it’s wrong because it’s a sin. It’s a sin because it is wrong.” Circular reasoning with no undergirding.

Christianity has an impressively complex history of moral and ethical philosophical. But when you reject the values in favor of self made rules, and reject the history in favor of simplicity, the system turns on itself.

The end result of this is a new identity that is defined by a rejection of the Christian identity. Christian holidays are all evil, pagan rituals. All the other Christians are fake Christians. It’s not loving to actually love someone, it’s only loving to condemn someone. People who preach the good news of Christ are soft and “sugarcoating.”

The point at which the new identity is based around opposition to the old religious identity is typically where you see a new religion form (ex. Christianity coming out of Judaism and Islam coming out of Christianity). But I do not see that this is possible with the way they’ve constructed the morality system of Christian Fundamentalism or how they’ve more or less ignored the other practical aspects of religion.",30,True,,,0.81,False,

What does it m an to be meek? To be humble and unassuming?

When we read of Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, do we think of servant leadership? Is there more to it?

I think it also speaks to the humiliation Jesus suffered in his life on Earth. Are we as Christians willing to suffer humiliation, not just at the hands of the world, but in the hands of our fellow Christ followers?

It seems that many Christians forget that the bible came about through the practice of theology many centuries ago, and instead decided studying that bible is the new definition of Theology.  

They have so lost any tolerance for new theologies that they have stagnated their faith, and can't understand it when people turn to charismatic charletons, or just abandon it all together.  If you suggest that something in their Bible might not be true or accurate, they react with horror, look dumbfounded, or patronize with pity.

I've always liked dressing up to go but even as kid it's like, you dress up TOO much and suddenly taken as dig at everyone else, which sucks because to me I really just want to bring out THE BEST for God. I feel like that about most church buildings as well, the architecture in most (American) churches is just like really. Really. Flat. To the point where after some churches closed they just get turned into movie theaters. Like, I could understand why there aren't stone pillars around the place or things like that but even stuff like the landscaping could be done up with a garden (esp community gardens!). I have my own little altar at home and it's decorated with different rocks I've found or other natural elements like flowers or meteor fragments or dinosaur bones, and it just makes the space look really nice. And at least for me, when things are nice you want to take care of it and engage it more but maybe for other people it's different? I don't necessarily want church to be like, disgustingly lavish but it sucks feeling like I have to go into spaces outside of church to go ""my best"" when I don't want to like, do that lol. High-key nowadays it's a lot of jeans and hoodies, and no shame in that, but it just feels weird growing up being told ""save your nicest for God!"" and then the nicest is too much evidently. But I guess the reasoning is that other people feel intimidated or distracted by it so you have to mind everyone else's level.

1gh59ja,Any recommendations for accessible and digestible content that can help me grow in my faith?,SwimDear9006,2024-11-01 13:22:32+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gh59ja/any_recommendations_for_accessible_and_digestible/,3,/r/Christianity/comments/1gh59ja/any_recommendations_for_accessible_and_digestible/,Christianity,"My relationship with God has been poor (to put it lightly) for several years now. The relationship deteriorated after both of my parents passed away slowly and painfully from illness right before my eyes, one right after the other. 

I'm interested in repairing my relationship with God, but I find it really hard to sit and read the Bible these days. I also find it hard to feel restored after church services. The lessons and stories from the Bible just aren't resonating with me. I don't find the lessons and stories to be relevant to the problems that I'm facing in every day life. 

I'm looking for a way to re-engage with my faith and restore my relationship with God in a way that's fun and accessible. Something that I actually *want* to engage in. Right now, I feel like I read the Bible and go to church out of a sense of obligation. I grew up in the church, so I understand that part of faith is having the discipline to read the Bible and go to church even when you don't want to, but it's also not realistic to keep this up for an extended period of time when I'm not feeling restored in my faith and I don't feel like my relationship with God is improving by going through these motions. I don't need overnight change, but I do need a glimmer of something to make it worth the work.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a book, podcast, study guide, or an individual pastor who I might want to check out that's really engaging and practical? I'm non-denominational. I'm Black but I certainly have no problem following non-Black pastors, authors, e.t.c. I've tried the 'Plans' in the 'Bible' app, and some of them are pretty engaging, but they're not really moving the needle for me.

For 16 years, I’ve always followed my own path and ended up in disaster (dating wise). My mother (65) always managed to bail me out in one way or another and I have always been grateful for that. I’ve been living with her and her bf (55 M) for about 3 years and though it’s been difficult, I am blessed. 
Here’s the issue: I met  a young man (35), who instantly became one of my closest friends and I began falling in love with him. He took me to California two years ago and when I came back, I just felt like becoming a nomad and traveling anywhere and everywhere. Recently, I told him that I was willing to stick by his side through whatever the Lord has for us and he was moved to tears. He’s only here in our home state until December, so I try to spend as much time with him as I can. This morning, however, my mother told me that the Lord wants me to be careful with him because he has a tendency to make people feel sorry for him and if I’m not careful, I could be left stranded. 
This, along with everything I’ve went through in life, hurt. All of my past relationships were disasters because God wasn’t at the center of them, but when I finally found someone who loves the Lord and actually likes me for who I am, it’s still not good enough. I usually trust my mom’s judgment, but I know that with what’s going on in her own relationship and the fact that she likes to remind me of my own mistakes often, I don’t know what to believe. I’m 31 and still not married, though I understand it’s not the end goal. All I want is to find someone that cares about me and loves me for me. I hate being alone and I hate myself for screwing up my life. 
Why can’t I hear God tell me this Himself? Why use my mother when He’s aware that she likes to bring up my past mistakes? Am I missing something? Help please if you can.

I am 28 years old and I have been a Christian relatively recently, 1 year and a few months. I was previously an atheist and a blasphemer. I started reading the holy biblie consistently since 3 months ago, most of the days. And a few days ago i watched some Dr. Stanley talks. He spoke of God's will and the Holy Spirit and His purpose for our lives. At that moment a thought arose to do something that I had discarded a few weeks ago, and that was to return as an intern to the hospital. As soon as the thought came to me, I was convinced that it was the holy spirit telling me what I should do. But then I began to have a lot of explanations for not doing it, even that perhaps it was Satan who wanted me to do that to distance myself from the will of God. I prayed to God to give me the intelligence to be able to discern between His will, which loves me and wants the best for me, and that of Satan who wants to destroy me. It is worth mentioning that I have been away from the hospital for 2 years and I do not want to return. God took me down another path where I had the blessing of knowing Him. So, how can I be sure that returning there does not lead me away from God's path or does God want me to come back? Throughout this year I had multiple invitations to return.

1gh7dx2,I saw someone on Youtube requesting for prayers for their eczema and...,alvinsujinkim92,2024-11-01 14:59:09+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gh7dx2/i_saw_someone_on_youtube_requesting_for_prayers/,2,/r/Christianity/comments/1gh7dx2/i_saw_someone_on_youtube_requesting_for_prayers/,Christianity,"I saw someone on Youtube requesting prayers for his/her eczema. I didn't see enough of it to know the person's gender because the people who posted it were a couple.

I need some prayers like this. I'll get my dirt out so you can get a little background of me.

I was a very provocative know-it-all kid. Always feeling sorry for myself. I always thought in the back of my head Jesus had my back because I wasn't understood by people when I would be provocative. I was the 'tester' by pushing others' buttons to see if they are the ideal emotionally stable role model.

If they failed at being that ideal person, I would sometimes give them a menacing smirk thinking I was right in Jesus' name. 

Oh, how wrong I was. I thought I was on the right for so, so long. 

In the bible it says Jesus hates evil doers and so do many credible pastors online. I started to truly fear Jesus afterwards. It's pathetic to start fearing Jesus only after that, but if doing that were to lead me to be blessed by Jesus, I will do so. I cried to Jesus yesterday, saying that I was so wrong for such a long time. I begged him like the person I was: thinking he was right for decades but just now learning that he was wrong. Being that confident. Arrogant is the right word. I felt safe doing so because I always had this sense of Christ being in the back of my head whenever I did something bad and knew it but needed someone to blame because I just didn't have the skill or ability to do the right thing. I just simply didn't know better because of all the damage that I've gone through.

When I was a kid I was raped, sexually abused and  physically harmed repetitively by family. I remember cursing Jesus in my prayers on my bedside. Of course there were times I asked for Jesus' help. I listened to my pastors and did everything I could to have Jesus hear my cries and love me. I would go back and forth cursing and professing my love to Jesus but eventually I gave up.

I don't remember what exact harm that influenced me to be a difficult child but I became determined by my own will to become one. I became determined to do wrong because I didn't want anyone to get close to me because I was afraid what my family would do to them. One time when another child at school would greet himself to me, I assaulted him at that spot. I would soil my pants in class. I don't remember if it was out of spite or bad gut health but it was certainly a mixture of both. I would act like a crazy person when out with family to make sure they need to get away from people like my family. That was my early childhood.

Somehow during my mid-to-late childhood I became numb to everything. Became a classic people pleaser. Used drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Skipped school. Got expelled from high school for selling weed. I was so addicted to weed that I smoked nearly everyday. My mom made a big deal out of it enough to the point where I was paranoid of her catching me all the time. I had to live my life a lie and always on edge. I wished that she was more lenient towards me using marijuana because it wasn't a serious drug. I kind of needed it for my anxiety. But anyway. I resented her for that so I betrayed her by being rebellious or emotionally cold with her whenever we would get close enough to know that we were great allies as we got along with eachother well. A part of me resented her for the fact that she never brought up the past about her abuse nor did she apologize.

Sorry it got this long. I don't think anyone is going to read this all but just in case, lol.

I have had severe eczema and had it since birth. About a decade ago(32 right now) I developed schizoaffective disorder.

This is so greedy coming from me but I wished that people would pray for me so I don't have to deal with eczema any more. I'm confident that I'll be a better person if it works... Just God, please no more... I suffered so much because of my skin. I think the origin of my family's harm towards me began because of the guilt they had because of my horrible eczema. My dad once told me the doctor who conceived me told him it was the worst case of eczema he has ever seen in his career. It was really that bad up until mid-child hood. So I can familiarize with my family also, instead of just purely hating them. 

That's enough about me. I wish there were enough prayers for Jesus to hear and grant them. Oh my god. I just find it so difficult to live with eczema. It is just so taxing energetically. If he is willing, I wish he can cure my mental illness as well. 

Please pray for me. I am far from the person I was. I became an on and off Christian for over a decade. I had decided to live a good life since then instead of doing wrong. At least for the most part. Please pray for me.

I pray every day asking the Lord to forgive my sins because I know as a human I'm going to commit them. Does this also mean that when I'm finally in the position to go to church freely do I have to confess every sin like me swearing on accident or something like that.

I filed for divorce from my husband in June due to his infidelity. This was not his first time cheating as he also stepped out on me when we were dating. 

We got married with the promise he’d changed and wanted to spend his life with me and build a family. My husband was not Christian when I met him, but he claimed he came to the feet of the Lord and few years after we dated. I’ll admit, my walk with Christ wasn’t the best example but it was always apparent he wasn’t really into Godly things - seems he was more in it to please me. 

I found out he was cheating on me for a few months in February. I tried hard at reconciliation but it was obvious he wasn’t in it. I spiraled and things between us got worse. I found out he never stopped talking to his affair partner. Call logs pretty much proved this affair was not only physical, but emotional. We have a kid together and this has been so hard to process. My husband claims we became roommates and he was no longer attracted to me due to my weight and other issues. He says this girl is his soulmate and they just met at the wrong time. 

They are now in a relationship while our divorce is ongoing and he’s currently on vacation with her meeting her family. He plans on introducing our son to her shortly as they have already signed a lease and are moving in together. All before we are even officially divorced. This has all happens in less than a year. 

This has been so difficult to process because he is stone cold toward me and our divorce hasn’t been amicable. I’m having such a hard time understanding how 14 years together means nothing to him and how he’s moving on so quickly with this new woman (she is younger with no kids). It seems to be serious if they are vacationing and meeting each other’s families. 

I need prayer badly. I don’t want to be angry with God as none of this is his doing or his fault. It’s just so hard to see a man I loved with all my heart move on so quickly and basically live consequence free. While he is no longer living in our home and has had to basically start over, he’s quickly recovered, has a good job, a new place to live and someone to love and be with. It feels like their relationship is being blessed while I’m left heartbroken picking up the pieces slowly with our kid.

[Isaiah 53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053&version=ESV) tells of the suffering of Jesus in a time when, if I'm correct, the thought regarding the Christ (Messiah) was that He would come to Earth to reign over the world (now understood to refer to a later time).

As far as I know, no one believed that the Christ would come here in a humble manner and serve as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of all.

Considering Jesus was definitely a real Person, Who had followers, going by those such as Tacitus and Josephus, it seems highly unlikely that His story was embellished in the Gospels.

Of note as well is that Jesus is definitely God ([Isaiah 9:6, Proverbs 30:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209%3A6%2C%20Proverbs%2030%3A4&version=ESV)), and going by Jude and Paul ([Jude 1:5, 1 Corinthians 10:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201%3A5%2C%201%20Corinthians%2010%3A1-5&version=ESV)), He is the One Who was with the Israelites during the Exodus.",100,True,,,0.63,False,

I’ve been reminded time and time again I have two options going forward live a life of Paul or marry a woman. I don’t want either. Each day my roommates tell me I am saved and changing so much. But they don’t know I come to the apartment in tears. I cry myself to sleep. I’ve read the whole New Testament and dated men knowing it was a sin. It’s been told to me ever since I was young. My sister saved me in August before I committed suicide. This was after seeing the Paris Olympics opening and seeing a demon for the first time. I am just upset. With each passing day when people tell me I’m damned to hell if I decide to date again others say I’m redeemed; I feel less and less human with comments like that. I’ve been battling with this for 10 years. I fasted, I’ve wept and prayed for death. I cannot continue with living in shame. I will either fall out of faith or live a sad Christian life of celibacy. I commit other sins without thinking such as hate, greed, gossip and others but that’s human and I feel like I’m damned for those sins as well. Everyone focuses on my sin while ignoring their own and I am tired of seeing that straight people act holier than though. I am giving god three more years to change me.

I've been wanting to share this for a few days but honestly needed time to process what happened. I've been really struggling with my faith lately - like seriously questioning if God was even real. But what happened the other night has completely shaken my world.

I was lying in bed, kind of half-heartedly praying and questioning God in my heart (with barely any faith tbh), when suddenly the Spirit of God came over me. It's hard to explain, but this kind of spiritual mist came over my mind, and I heard God's voice. I am sure it wasn’t my voice. It didn’t have a “human voice” per se, it was more of I could hear the words without hearing it. It was incredibly powerful - imagine the sound of a huge waterfall but also as clear as a trumpet. He said ""Behold the works of My hands. Haven't I created everything perfectly?""

Then this name just appeared in my spirit: Elohim. I actually called out ""Elohim, is this really You?"" I didn't hear a voice back, but somehow I just KNEW in my spirit that it was Him.
Then He told me He would show me heaven, but that I would have to ""taste death"" first. My heart started rapidly pounding and having palpitations, then it literally stopped beating. I felt my spirit being pulled downward, like going through layers of curtains, each one taking me deeper.

What I saw next... I can barely describe it. You know those angels Ezekiel saw? I saw something like that - this being made of pure light, shaped like an orb with wings all around it. It had eyes everywhere, with this massive eye in the middle (like the ones Isaiah saw that kept saying ""Holy, Holy, Holy""). I couldn't see it super clearly - kind of like seeing a reflection in choppy water, or looking through a dark glass, and it was low quality?- but clear enough to know how terrifying and glorious it was.

There were these purple clouds around it, and one cloud was shining like pure gold with God's glory.

Then my spirit literally lifted up to the corner of my room and I saw my own body lying there. When I came back to my body I was shaking so bad I ran to my mom's room crying and waking her up. God's presence is seriously overwhelming for a human to experience.
I've spent the last few days trying to process this. I know I have to completely change my life now. I can't just go back to how I was living before. It's like... I can't unsee what I saw, you know? God's presence is like this consuming fire now. I'm realizing how far I'd wandered from Him, how much I was hurting my own spirit by turning away from the truth. I can't just be ignorant anymore or pretend I don't know better.
The crazy thing is, I wasn't even a ""good Christian"" when this happened. I was literally failing at every attempt to follow Jesus. I was still living in sin, still choosing temporary pleasures over God. But He showed up anyway, right in the middle of my doubt and failure. Now His presence is like this consuming fire and I'm honestly terrified by what that means for my life. Everything in me wants to go back to my old life of just doing whatever feels good.

How do you even begin to change your whole life? I don't know how to be a Christian. I have commitment issues and have been struggling with faith. But I know what I experienced was real.

My heart feels so heavy because I know I have to let my old self die and really commit to following Jesus. I have to surrender everything. His presence used to be this abstract concept, but now it's this overwhelming reality and I'm honestly terrified by what that means for my life. Everything in me wants to resist giving up control and dying to my own desires.

I can't be halfway committed anymore. Living for God means dying to everything I thought was important and that's really scary.
I guess I'm posting because I need support from people who might understand. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How do you move forward when you've had such a clear encounter with God? Like, how do you live a normal life after something like this?

And yes, I'm 100% sure this wasn't a dream or hallucination. This was real. Please keep praying for me as I figure out how to walk this out.

To those worried for me about drugs/mental health - I appreciate the concern but that's not what this was. I know the difference between a spiritual experience and other things. I'm just trying to be faithful to what God showed me.",8,True,Support,support,0.88,False,Support

During this pregnancy, i found out that my husband cheated on me with his ex girlfriend while we were dating. I also found out that he has been watching porn our entire marriage (after previously promising to stop) 

I decided to forgive him and move forward. Only a few months later, i caught him watching porn again. Since then, I’ve been extremely disconnected. We have had conversations about porn so many times. I have been told countless of times that it wouldn’t happen again, yet here we are. 

We are extremely emotionally disconnected. At one point we were connected, but my deepest emotions and feelings have been used as a weapon against me, at this point I don’t feel like he is a safe person for me to open up to.

I feel like the only thing I’m good for is sex. That’s the only thing he wants from me anymore. And if I’m not having sex with him, i must be cheating. 

I opened up with my pastor last week. He recommended therapy and I brought it up to my husband. We did therapy with a non-Christian therapist and it didn’t work for us. He is extremely against trying anything again.

That not only leads to extreme bias towards certain subjects here, but it goes against the supposed aim of the sub to begin with.

In the Reformation Day thread, I got in a discussion with a Catholic who essentially said all Protestants are delusional for not believing Jesus established the Catholic Church in the ""Peter is the Rock"" verse.  I of course disagreed and was insulted for my disagreement.  The poster in question then said the opinions of the early Church fathers on the Catholic church being the only true one is all he cares about, and I pointed out that's a flawed argument since most of the early Church fathers were Antisemites, some even calling for exterminating all Jews.  

This was flagged as being ""belittling Christianity"".  And yet, we've had numerous discussions of the early Church Saints on this sub where people call them some of the most evil people in Christian history, especially those like John Chrysostom, with those posts not getting removed.

There seems to be a distinct bias from some of the mods here about arguing against any of the hateful, immoral elements of Christianity history or debating certain flawed understandings of it (like the establishment of the Catholic Church.). A rule that doesn't allow you to criticize an immoral person like John Chrysostom is not a just rule.  It's just used to silence criticism.

This rule gets abused more than almost any other I've seen here except maybe Two Cents.

""Belittling Christianity"" should apply to comments like ""Your religion is dumb and you should stop believing in a Sky fairy.""  Or ""Christianity is the worst religion ever.""

The rule should not apply to comments like ""Jesus did not create the Catholic Church"" or ""many of the early Church fathers were immoral Antisemites.""

It’s crazy how much I still align with a lot of the Christian values but my faith has vanished and never came back. I’m 31 and still a virgin but not because I am waiting until marriage.

Part of why I have been a virgin for so long, is because I was initially waiting until marriage, now that I don’t believe, I don’t know why I am waiting still. I think a part of me still sees the beauty in giving my all to one person. 

I love Jesus’ (whether I believe he is real or not) message of loving people. I don’t believe in the lgbtq movement but I still show them love and kindness and respect.

I still believe in the value of putting people before myself though it’s screwed me over many times. 

I still believe in the value of modesty. I can relate to a lot of Christians but I just don’t believe in God anymore. I sometimes wish I could have different values because it’s hard being around those that have diff values. It’s not like I’m striving anymore like I used to, so I could go to heaven, so why bother.

Message:

BOAST IN GOD

Whether we realize it or not, being proud and boastful is part of our character. A simple example is when we get excellent results in our Math exam we may want to say, “Well, I didn’t study hard before the Math test, but I managed to get excellent marks.” It is a kind of boastfulness that implies that we are smart.

We need to realize that whatever we have right now is not because of our might and power. Everything we have – our wealth, talent, ability, health, and position, is all because God allows it. Our human weaknesses cause us to put God aside when we are in the top situations in life. We often forget that God is the source and the giver of everything we own. 

God reminds us not to be boastful with what we own. What is in our hearts will determine our attitude. The Word of God says, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.” (Matthew 6:21). So when we treasure something as valuable in our life, that is where our heart will be. Therefore, we need to have a humble heart, realizing that everything comes from God. It’s all God’s gift. Let’s make Jesus the most valuable treasure in life. Then we can boast in God.

We will be able to boast in God when He becomes the most valuable treasure in our lives.

I wasn't born in an happy family, I mean, I wasn't born between drugs or alchol or criminals, but my parents broke up when I was only 5, so you can guess they didn't really like eachother after some time they know eachother. Anyways, I think all my problems started because of them, because of their anger; I was born from anger, and I became anger, the older I got, the dangerous I got. When I was in the kindergarten, I was the most dangerous kid in all of it, for example, once, I stucked a fork (Yes, a fucking fork) in the arm of another kid. I also beaten tens of them, and no other child could stop me, cause I've always been the biggest one in the class. At the end, I got out of the kindergarten, and everyone went to their own way. After that, elementary school begun. The more I grew up, the less violent I became, but I was much more hateful. But what happens when a monster encounters another one? Well, that's what happened with me and my elementary school teacher, a long time ago. She was the eviliest one ever, and I was too, but I was unable to beat her: I already knew that, if I killed her, I was going to prison, and so, after 5 years of suffering and hate rising, I left the elementary school. In middle school I wasn't calmer, but I wasn't as violent as before (Like I said, the older I got, the less violent I became, but the wrath was the same), and the professors were very funny and they knew how to treat me...Some of them even became my friends due to my skills in manipulating them. It may sound that the middle school was easy, but it wasn't: there was a bully in sixth grade. We were the same size, but he...He had a fucking gang with him, and I thank God, because He saved me from these criminals. In the eight grade, there was a huge beef with a teacher, and they took me to a damn hospital for mentally ill people. I stayed there for 21 days, and they I finally came out. The highschool story is still writing itself. Apart from the school, I hate my mother, cause she's an idiot, and my father isn't much better. The only person I truly loved (In terms of family love, of course) was my grandma, she's the one who made me a christian...She died 3 years ago.
My path isn't just full of, it IS wrath. The only thing I'm afraid of is going to Hell.
Oh, and adding to all the Hell stuff, I'm also bisexual and a lustful, and an hypocrite...And many other things. I can't even repent.
What should I do, end myself for all the sins I did?

1gh1y6o,What did Jesus mean by “upon this rock I will build my church” in Matthew 16:18?,J0hn-Rambo,2024-11-01 10:07:56+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gh1y6o/what_did_jesus_mean_by_upon_this_rock_i_will/,0,/r/Christianity/comments/1gh1y6o/what_did_jesus_mean_by_upon_this_rock_i_will/,Christianity,"Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “**Who do people say that the Son of Man is?**” And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon [Peter](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4074/esv/mgnt/0-1/) replied, “**You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.**” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are [Peter](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4074/esv/mgnt/0-1/), and **on this** [**rock**](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4073/esv/mgnt/0-1/) **I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it**. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” **Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that** **he was the Christ****.** ([Matthew 16:13-20 ESV](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/16/13-20/s_945013))

After Jesus declares that God the Father had revealed the truth to Peter, He says, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church” ([Matthew 16:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/16/18/s_945018)). The word for “Peter”, [petros](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4074/esv/mgnt/0-1/), is a masculine noun that means “a rock or a stone”. The word for “rock” next mentioned is a different Greek word, [petra](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4073/esv/mgnt/0-1/), a feminine noun that means “a rock, cliff, or ledge” and therefore something foundational. The difference in the two terms may suggest that Jesus was contrasting Peter with Himself. That is, Jesus was saying, “You are the small rock, but I am the foundation of the church”. This view finds support in other passages that present Christ, not Peter, as the foundation of the church ([1 Corinthians 3:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1co/3/11/s_1065011)) and the spiritually nourishing Rock of our fathers ([1 Corinthians 10:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1co/10/4/s_1072004)).

Of course, the apostles played a foundational role in the building of the church, but the role of primacy is reserved for Christ alone. So, Jesus’ words in [Matthew 16:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/16/18/s_945018) are best interpreted as a simple play on words: a boulder-like, foundational truth came from the mouth of one who was called a small stone.

Christ Himself is called the “chief cornerstone” ([1 Peter 2:6–8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1pe/2/6-8/s_1153006); compare [Matthew 21:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/21/42/s_950042)). The chief cornerstone of any building was that upon which a building is anchored. If Christ declared Himself to be the cornerstone, how could Peter be the rock upon which the church was built? Believers are the stones that make up the church. They are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (not just Peter) and joined together with the Cornerstone—Christ Jesus ([Ephesians 2:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/eph/2/20/s_1099020)). “The one who believes in Him will not be put to shame” ([1 Peter 2:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1pe/2/6/s_1153006)).

The Roman Catholic Church argues that Peter is the rock upon which Jesus built His church, confers upon Peter the title of pope, and claims to be the one true church. As we have seen, however, identifying the rock as Peter is not the true interpretation of [Matthew 16:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/16/18/s_945018). Besides, it was after this that Peter denied Jesus three times ([Matthew 26:69-75](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mat/26/69-75/s_955069); [Mark 14:66-72](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/mar/14/66-72/s_971066); [Luke 22:54-62](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/luk/22/54-62/s_995054); [John 18:15-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/jhn/18/15-18/s_1015013), [25-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/jhn/18/25-27/s_1015013)). Furthermore, even if Peter was intended as the rock upon which Jesus promised to build His church, it does not give the Roman Catholic Church any authority. Scripture nowhere records Peter being in Rome. Scripture nowhere describes Peter as being supreme over the other apostles. The New Testament does not describe Peter as being the all-authoritative leader of the early church. The origin of the Catholic Church is not in the teachings of Peter or any other apostle. If Peter truly was the founder of the Roman Catholic Church, it would be in full agreement with what Peter taught ([Acts 2:14-41](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/act/2/14-41/s_1020014), [1 Peter](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1pe/1/1/s_1152001), [2 Peter](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/2pe/1/1/s_1157001)).

**“For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (**[**1 Corinthians 3:11 ESV**](https://www.blueletterbible.org/esv/1co/3/11/s_1065011)**)**",2,True,,,0.5,False,

I was seeing exactly what he was seeing, but I could not control him, though I was conscious.

I can’t wrap my mind around it, and it sends me into panic attacks and I can’t understand WHY.

It was covered under Leviticus 15:16. It only makes you unclean for a day and there was no sin sacrifice needed. The same unclean as a menstruating woman or one who just gave birth.

Things that were not sins in the OT did not suddenly become sins in the NT.

For those thinking ""lustfull"" thoughts is the sin, God made this rule, and masturbation has not changed from the beginning. Therefore, God knew it would involve some fantasy in your head.  Notice,  there is no caveat in the Law about thinking about others while you do it.

For those thinking sexual immorality covers masturbation, it did not in the OT so it cannot in the NT. There was a long list of uncovering nakedness that said nothing about it. 

For those thinking Leviticus covers only nocturnal emmissions, there is a separate verse in Deuteronomy on that. The early Jews considered Leviticus to cover ANY semen emission. There is a verse on if it occurs with your wife,  and then everything else.

And no, Onan was not about spilling seed. He did not perform his duties to his brother. Onan's death is attributed to his refusal to fulfill his obligation of levirate marriage with Tamar by committing coitus interruptus (which is NOT masturbation to begin with).

For those who like to bring up Matthew, someone in his equation is married. It's not a general command for everyone.

The Indian Orthodox are celebrating the death of the 96 year old Catholicose of the rival Syriac Orthodox Church in Kerala on social media.

A page with 46,000 followers and run by die hard supporters of the Indian Orthodox faction posted, ""When our Catholicose died, you people celebrated it. Now it is fitting karma that when your self appointed Catholicose died, entire country is celebrating Diwali, the hindu festival of lights"". Hundreds of people shared and commented with joy on such posts.

Both factions are known to routinely disrupt each others funerals and celebrate the death of bishops of the opposing side. They have a century long court litigation in the secular courts over ownership of the churches.

Despite being just 2% of the tiny Indian state of Kerala numbering around only 6,00,000 people in both factions (less than 0.1% of India), the shame and mocking that these people bring to the Gospels and Eastern Christianity in India is saddening. National media routinely cover their mishaps and endless series of sex scandals.

With lowering birth rates, rise of atheism and church scandals, it is doubtful if these communities can survive the next two decades.

1ggvkhb,Who is Holy Sophia? ,Autopilot_Psychonaut,2024-11-01 02:32:05+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ggvkhb/who_is_holy_sophia/,2,/r/Christianity/comments/1ggvkhb/who_is_holy_sophia/,Christianity,"She is a spirit—a created being, feminine in nature, and portrayed throughout scripture as Wisdom. In the Bible and apocryphal texts, Wisdom is always described in feminine terms, with even Christ referring to Wisdom as a motherly figure in Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:35. This portrayal establishes Sophia as a nurturing, guiding presence that reflects God’s truth.

We refer to her as Sophia, the Greek term for Wisdom, because it highlights her personhood in a way the English word “wisdom” does not. In Hebrew, she is called Ruach Chokmah, meaning the spirit of wisdom, which captures her essence as a spiritual, living presence. Calling her Holy Sophia acknowledges her sacred role and distinguishes her from the many Sophias in the world, while respecting her created nature as a vessel of divine wisdom—not a divine being herself.

The Bible tells us that God is a spirit (John 4:24), eternal and self-existent, and that He created other spirits to fulfill specific roles within creation. A spirit is an immaterial, personal being who exists beyond the physical world yet can have influence within it. These created spirits, like Sophia and angels, act as messengers, guides, or agents of divine purpose. Each has a unique identity and role as part of God’s design.

As stated in Ecclesiasticus, “The Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel. He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail” (Ecclesiasticus 24:8-9). This passage emphasizes that Sophia’s existence was established by God’s commandment from the beginning, marking her as a purposeful creation who dwells among His people to guide them in divine truth.

In Wisdom of Solomon 6:22, the text states, “I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be, and I will hide no secrets from you,” underscoring that Sophia’s origins and purpose are intentional and knowable. And in Wisdom of Solomon 9:9, “And Wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world.” Here, Sophia’s presence at creation reflects her foundational role without implying she existed before creation itself; she was present because God established her to witness and guide creation from the start.

Proverbs 8:22-31 further enriches our understanding of Sophia’s role. In this passage, Wisdom speaks, saying, “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.” Sophia was present before creation, “rejoicing always” as God’s works unfolded. As Wisdom describes, “When he prepared the heavens, I was there… when he established the clouds above… I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him” (Proverbs 8:27-30). Her joy extended even to humanity, “And my delights were with the sons of men” (Proverbs 8:31), highlighting her love for those she was created to guide.

Sophia’s presence is both a gift and a call from God. As James 1:5 says, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” Here, God’s gift of wisdom is extended to all who seek it, showing that Sophia’s guidance is meant for those who desire understanding and righteousness. At the same time, she actively reaches out to everyone, as Proverbs 1:20-21 tells us: “Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates.” Sophia calls out publicly, inviting all people to come to her and learn the ways of God, making her guidance universally accessible.

In this way, Sophia’s nature as a created spirit shows us God’s wisdom through a nurturing, motherly lens, giving us a way to approach divine truth with understanding and reverence. She serves as a reflection of God’s wisdom, making it accessible and understandable to us, embodying her role as God’s first creation and a bridge between the infinite wisdom of God and humanity’s need for guidance.",3,True,,,0.67,False,

As Christians, we all strive to follow Jesus faithfully. We read our Bibles, attend church, worship, and share our faith, believing that these actions honor God. These practices are central to what we do as believers. But, could it be that in doing all these things, we sometimes miss something essential? What if we’re overlooking the very heart of Jesus’ teachings—His command to love others as ourselves?

I’m not here to criticize or point fingers. Rather, I’m inviting all of us (myself included) to examine how we live out our faith. What does it mean to genuinely reflect Jesus’ love? Are there ways we could be more like Him in how we treat others? This isn’t about questioning our commitment. Instead, it’s about asking ourselves, as individuals and as a church, if we sometimes focus so much on doing the ‘right’ things that we overlook the deeper call to love without conditions. Jesus didn’t say, “Love your neighbor only if they’re like you or agree with you.” And He certainly didn’t say, “Love only those who love you back.” His love was—and is—for everyone, without exception.

This reflection serves as an invitation: a chance to consider if we’re truly embodying Jesus’ love in our lives and in our communities.

The Rich Young Ruler: Missing the Heart of Faith
(Matthew 19:16-22)

Consider the story of the rich young ruler. This man approached Jesus confidently, feeling he had done everything right. He asked, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus responded by listing several commandments, to which the young man replied, “I’ve kept all these since my youth. What do I still lack?”

Jesus then gave a response that struck at his heart: “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” The young man walked away saddened, as he was very wealthy. Although he had followed the commandments, his attachment to wealth hindered him from responding to Jesus’ deeper call to sacrifice and love. Jesus isn’t impressed by external obedience alone; He desires a love that flows from the heart. We need to ask ourselves if we’re genuinely loving our neighbors as Jesus commanded or merely checking off a list of religious practices.

The Church and Judgment: Reflecting Jesus’ Compassion
(John 4:1-26)

In the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus challenged societal norms by speaking with a woman of another ethnicity, one often scorned by Jewish society. He met her where she was, aware of her struggles and shortcomings, yet He extended compassion and grace rather than judgment.

As a church, we have often been quick to judge, especially when it comes to groups like the LGBTQ community. When we condemn and point fingers, we fail to reflect the love of Christ. Instead, we push people further away. And when those we have rejected criticize the church, we cannot just dismiss it as a “sign of end times.” We must recognize that sometimes we cause this division by neglecting Jesus’ commandment to love.

Addressing “Is It a Sin?” with Grace

When it comes to questions about sin, especially around topics like sexuality, we often jump to rules, judgments, and interpretations. Yet, if we look closely, Jesus’ ministry took a different approach. Jesus focused on compassion and humility rather than condemnation.

Consider the story of the woman caught in adultery. The law demanded punishment, but Jesus told those present, “Let anyone who is without sin be the first to throw a stone” (John 8:7). Rather than condemning, He extended grace. When it comes to topics like sexuality, perhaps the better question isn’t, “Is this a sin?” but “How would Jesus have us respond?” If our response is judgment, we risk driving people away from Christ’s love. Jesus calls us to a love that embraces others as they are, embodying God’s grace.

Unity vs. Divisive Rhetoric

In recent years, we’ve seen prominent figures promote division and resentment. Such rhetoric creates an “us vs. them” mentality, harming the unity Christ calls us to. Martin Luther King Jr., inspired by his Christian faith, countered such divisiveness with love and nonviolence. He famously said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”

For the church, the choice is clear: Will we align ourselves with language that divides or with the Gospel’s command to love? Christ’s example challenges us to reflect His compassion in a divided world.

The Good Samaritan and Living the Commandments
(Luke 10:25-37)

In the parable of the Good Samaritan, religious leaders passed by a man in need, but a Samaritan—someone viewed as an outsider—stopped to help. Jesus used this story to redefine what it means to be a neighbor, showing that love is greater than religious ritual.

Our faith isn’t about displaying rules or symbols; it’s about living a life of love. The Ten Commandments are not about rule-keeping but an invitation to love God and others.

A Call to Reflect and to Love
(John 13:1-17)

In one of His last acts with His disciples, Jesus washed their feet, demonstrating that His love was active, sacrificial, and rooted in humility. He said, “I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.”

The problem within the church today is that we think we’re succeeding by checking off religious boxes. But without love, we miss the heart of Jesus’ message. Like the rich young ruler, we may feel we’re doing everything right while walking away from the true essence of faith.

So, I ask us today: Are we willing to move beyond routines and truly love our neighbors? Are we ready to lay down our pride, judgments, and agendas? Are we willing to love people the way Jesus loved us—unconditionally and with open hearts?

1ggpbe0,"Jesus taught that heaven is within, not a deferred reward experienced post-death",OptimalTbh,2024-10-31 21:16:40+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ggpbe0/jesus_taught_that_heaven_is_within_not_a_deferred/,4,/r/Christianity/comments/1ggpbe0/jesus_taught_that_heaven_is_within_not_a_deferred/,Christianity,"**(the emboldened text emphasize the instructions he explicitly taught to trigger an awakening** **and access the bliss of heaven available within everyone)**

[source](https://actualchristianity.net/2024/10/31/heaven-is-not-a-place-you-go-to/)

The notion that 'heaven' is only accessible after death exemplifies a significant misunderstanding prevalent in mainstream Christianity, distorting the clear teachings of Jesus. This misinterpretation of when heaven is experienced can be verified firsthand when one faithfully follows Jesus' own instructions on how to trigger a spiritual awakening. There is a reason Jesus captivated and astonished those around him during his lifetime. He elevated human consciousness and triggered profound awakenings in his peers and followers. They didn’t return post-death to tell him he was right. They experienced it in their lifetime when they were alive. Word of mouth from those that experienced these awakenings goes a long way.

Jesus taught that 'heaven' resides within us, a metaphorical “realm” that can be unlocked through intentional effort and spiritual practice. As one embarks on this transformative journey, the universe responds by rolling out the red carpet, welcoming those who express a genuine desire for spiritual awakening. **He proclaimed that the kingdom is both within us and all around us (Luke 17:21)**, inviting us to realize that we need not wait for paradise after death; it is accessible here and now.

As someone who used to identify as an atheist, I often argued that one cannot prove what happens after death; it all relies on blind faith. However, the truth is that profound divine and spiritual experiences can be experienced during our lifetime, allowing everyone to explore and test these truths for themselves. This should allow us to breathe a huge sigh of relief. No need to go on faith when you can test and experience this right here and now.

Heaven can be aptly described as the experience of total oneness—a deep unity with the universe, all of humanity, and the infinite. Such an experience is unattainable at lower levels of consciousness, where our egos reside.

The term 'heaven' was ultimately repurposed to capture the bliss and euphoria that arises when we unlock this profound spiritual awakening within ourselves. A term normally used to describe the cosmos and galaxies above, was now being used to serve as a poignant reminder of our fundamental unity with the cosmos and bestowing upon us an enduring sense of euphoria and ecstasy to put it mildly. It is no wonder that the terms for the stars above and profound happiness have become synonymous in our collective consciousness. Remembering our unity with the stars above and our fellow humans that surround us, brings us total ecstasy and joy.

This bliss and happiness are your birthright, accessible to you in the present moment rather than after you die. Jesus frequently employed metaphors and symbolism, and it is essential to understand that his description of Heaven as a 'kingdom' was intended as a symbolic representation. In more literal terms, it signifies a state of spiritual awakening and heightened consciousness that can be attained in this lifetime, not a physical kingdom we literally stroll into.

Recalibrating your mind to experience oneness with the universe is fundamental to Jesus’ teachings by **reminding ourselves that we are all 'brothers/sisters' and 'children of our Father** (the universe)**.'** Through his use of symbolism and metaphors, he always sought to convey the profound truth of our interconnectedness. Regularly reminding yourself of this reality can prime you to experience a state of total unity. 

Every action you take toward others inevitably reverberates back to you, for we are all intimately linked. This is the essence of the golden rule: **""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""**

**Another significant misconception perpetuated by mainstream Christianity is the belief that one must 'accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior' to access spiritual enlightenment. In truth, Jesus never taught that this was a necessary prerequisite for attaining such a state**. It can be easily argued that Christians should take Jesus down off the pedestal we put him on, because he never wanted to or asked to be worshiped. He taught that he was one with our greater father, as we all are. It is something we can all be reminded of ourselves if his directions are correctly followed.

As previously mentioned, Jesus astonished his peers and followers by revealing how to trigger a spiritual awakening and how to access the 'heaven' he explicitly stated lies within each of us. He won people over not by promising something to them something they couldn’t verify, rather he won them over by teaching them demonstrably effective methods, ideas and concepts.  He taught simple, profound instructions aimed at inner transformation.

**He guided people on how to invoke the Holy Spirit, the very consciousness of the universe, and consistently encouraged them to choose the path of peace—whether through acts of forgiveness or turning the other cheek. The natural order of the universe is one of harmony, and the discord we experience stems from our egos, which cling to materialism, selfishness, individuality, and territoriality.**

A comprehensive definition of spiritual ""sin"" can be distilled into any action that is egocentric, lacking in consideration for others, and driven by selfish motives. There is no need to consult the bible to identify what is ‘sinful’. Any action that meets the aforementioned criteria will readily signal that you have strayed from your true path and are out of harmony with the universe.

While the Sermon on the Mount offers valuable guidelines for living a meaningful life, the Lord’s Prayer serves as an especially profound foundation. In this prayer, you affirm your intention to yield to the greater will of the universe, rather than to your ego's fleeting desires, which have never led to true happiness. **The phrase ""Thy will be done"" encapsulates this surrender, emphasizing a commitment to align with the universe's inherent will. It is essential to approach this prayer with genuine understanding and belief in what you are declaring. Furthermore, the act of forgiving others and fostering peace, as encouraged in the prayer, restores your alignment with the natural flow of existence. Holding onto grudges or resentment is akin to jamming the gears that generate happiness and love, hindering your capacity for genuine joy.**

Unfortunately, many preachers and pastors often overlook the core tenets of Jesus' teachings. They assert that one need only ""accept Jesus"" without guiding individuals to embrace and practice the principles and practices that lead to spiritual fulfillment. 

**Jesus was a teacher who showed people how to harness the Holy Spirit and elevate our consciousness beyond the confines of the ego, yet he never demanded worship as a prerequisite for spiritual awakening.** This disconnect explains why some modern Christians may proudly identify as ""True Christians"" while openly and unabashedly expressing hatred toward others. They mistakenly believe that mere belief in Jesus suffices, while neglecting the deeper roadmap within their own faith that reveals the pathway to experiencing heaven on earth—an experience Jesus described as residing within us.

For those who find parallels to Eastern spiritual practices unsettling, it is essential to recognize that both traditions draw from universal truths. Jesus did not possess exclusive rights to these profound insights; rather, many of the teachings he imparted were echoed in Buddhism long before his time. The convergence of these teachings arises from the fact that objective truths remain constant, irrespective of the teacher's identity. **Jesus undeniably operated from a nondualistic perspective, emphasizing our interconnectedness rather than separation**.

Unfortunately, many contemporary Christians often create divisive boundaries, proclaiming, ""This is my group; we are the true believers, and you will face condemnation."" Such tribalism exemplifies the ego's tendency to assert superiority over others. Ironically, this mindset contradicts the very essence of Jesus’ teachings, which resonate with those found in other faiths. **Condemning other groups for their beliefs only reveals a misunderstanding of Jesus' core message: we are all united, deserving of respect and compassion.**

While it is accurate for Christians to regard Jesus as the appointed teacher of spiritual awakening, it is equally valid to recognize that figures like Buddha also followed the universe's guiding path, surrendering to its greater will. The insistence on proclaiming ""my team is better than yours"" must come to an end. In truth, we are all part of the same collective team and journey. Acknowledging this interconnectedness will help realign Christians with their true purpose and foster the dismantling of divisive labels. The ego's incessant drive for separation is ultimately detrimental and stands in stark opposition to both the nature of the universe and the teachings of Jesus.",14,True,,,0.64,False,

I'm a believer, orthodox. I do everything I can to avoid sin and follow God. Yet I suffer, way more than I would like to. I feel like I don't get anything good in life. I can't get my life right. I'm still pretty young though (teen) and this may sound ridiculous to a lot of you, but I have to get this off my mind, and I think I can find answers or wisdom here.

I have close to no social life. I make people uncomfortable when I'm around them. I have 2 good friends and that's pretty much it. In the eyes of everyone else, I'm a freak, a circus beast, an ugly and sad clown. My body looks mid even though I work out and I won't talk about my face. One of my friends is atheist as heck and he seems to get good thing after good thing while all I get is failure after failure. He has a great family, a beautiful girlfriend that genuinely loves him, had an active sex life before getting with the girl, and a full social life. He's basically a popular kid. God gives him everything he wants, even thought the dude doesn't pray, doesn't go to church, doesn't respect religions (but respects the people), and doesn't have any Christian value. I DO MY BEST TO BE A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND I GET SPAT IN THE FACE.

There's this girl, that I like. And she's the only thing that I ask for. She's the only person that I ask God to give me. My family ain't the richest in the neighborhood, we're very indebted and i would very much like to be the generous guy that pays for his friends lunch, but I can barely afford mine, since I don't have a job. And I don't ask Him for money, all I want is that girl. Just that girl, and I'll be happy. Yet, God had to make it a competition, since I learnt that my other friend liked her too. Also, right when I was starting to get close to her, a fake rumor about me started which gave me a very bad image, and she was one of the first to know about it. Guess that REALLY sucks for me!

I don't get it. I feel like He's giving everything to other people while I get nothing. I'm doing everything I can while these others don't do nothing. I feel like He's treating me unfairly. Does he really love me? Do I really deserve this suffering? And I'm done hearing that ""God's plan"" excuse, it's just like saying ""shut up and take it"". It's dumb. Whatever, man. It's gone to such a point that I don't really value my life anymore, I don't wanna hurt anyone, but I don't know how much of this I can take anymore.

Why were Adam and Eve cast out? I'm aware of the fruit, but it's not the fruit itself that caused it right? Was it their choice to hide and lie? With him being all knowing, I'm assuming he came down because he knew what they did and was trying to help. But I'm no theologian by any means.

Was it because Eden was perfect and their sins made them imperfect? Or is it really just as simple as disobeying him with their free will?

I didn't know him well but I did similar work and got his card in case something popped up and what do you know something happened and I needed a job. So I didn't know him  well but I knew him. He's not a terrible guy or anything. He just struggles with pride. And can be defensive and lacking accountability. From my understanding the business used to be bigger. More like 12-15 employees. Now there are 5 and a part time sales guy. There used to be a operations manager so I don't know the whole deal but he used to do more like sales stuff and building relationships with customers and had some one to do the day to day stuff. So he was more of a owner with some one able to handle the daily things. Now there isn't one. I don't know I kinda feel like he has the mentality that he's too good to do certain stuff. Just a example my first or second day I asked the sort of human resources person she's not really even human resources she was just doing some human resources type stuff. But she had no experience and was learning as she went. Anyways I asked her about direct deposit and she was like I know we have direct deposit but I honestly have never set it up for any one. You would probably have to ask the owner. Anyways he comes in and says welcome aboard thanks for joining us if there's anything you need let me know. And I was like actually I want to set up direct deposit. Before I got the chance to say the financial person said she isn't sure how to do it he kinda snapped at me saying oh I don't do that I let the financial people do that it's not my role. Like he was offended I asked him. Just a example. He isn't a terrible guy or anything. He just sort of dumps extra roles on people that they have no idea how to do and just expects people to figure it out. One day he asked me if I did something that he never asked me to do. I was like oh well I didn't I didn't know we needed that done and he sort of looked at me like I was a idiot and was like I'm sure I asked you I was just like sorry I really don't think I was told this. Again he looked offended. Anyways long story short he's a Christian and I'm a Christian and I forget the exact verse but it's something a long the lines of better a harsh word from a friend then honey from a enemy. Basically if I'm a good brother in Christ I would talk to him about it. I'm just worried especially since the issue is pride and defensiveness he won't take it well. But it's really bothering me. A co worker just left because he was sick of getting thrown new roles that he wasn't hired to do. I don't know I think I have to. Is this a bad idea? Hopefully he can put work aside and realize it's me as a brother not me as a employee ,8,True,,,1.0,False,

He bestowed upon us nobility through work, pleasure through sacrifice, wisdom through failure, and ecstasy through conquering the impossible. Only our souls possess the power to create the best in the universe by cultivating the best within ourselves. When the body is exhausted, the Creator grants us His paradise in His heavens, where we attain the finest without toil. Deprivation rightfully deserves all who denied their destiny in destruction—destruction for the sake of the best, no matter how far-fetched it may seem.

Our destruction for the best is our destiny and our happiness, no matter how much we deny it. Souls are subdued to attain security, hearts tremble from losing the familiar, minds accept humiliation to deserve the luxury of comfort and bliss. In that moment, denial manifests, causing the soul to stray from destiny, and happiness departs without hope or expectation. The soul is left with only the question: ""Why all this hardship?"" and the universe screams: ""You have degraded, dear human.""

No matter how varied humanity’s paths may be, one must remember well that there is no merit in a person who has created their superiority with bare hands, possessed their dreams, and mastered the impossible.

I will try to keep this as short as possible.

A few years back, I got into my faith and had ended up with very bad religious compulsions and obessions which eventually lead to me being sleep deprived, miserable and left with no interest or energy for anything; including my faith. 

I got out that funk and honestly do not remember how, it sort of just happened, but i do remember becoming atheist at that time as well because of said issues. 

I’ve decided to get back into my faith again and am met with and overwhelmed by compulsions, anxiety and obsession with every little thing in life that could be a sin. 

I’ve stopped drawing and singing, things i adore doing simply because i have a huge (i know, irrational)  fear that God would become angry with me for doing. I know that this does not make sense but my brain has a hard time grasping this. 

I cannot do simple things without thinking that for some reason I will be punished and something horrible will happen.

I don’t have a good enough reason not to have sex before marriage, but I know that lust is not good and sex outside the context of love is bad because it’s just using each other and it’s lust. I’m not even in a relationship but I would really like to cement my beliefs before entering one.

So just looking for peoples thoughts on this. Truthfully I do not have a healthy relationship with sexuality, struggled with a porn addiction since I was 8-9, since have made great progress stopping,but  having done that for so long I just have the thought that no sexuality is good sexuality bc of how I feel about having abused myself for so long. Just struggling with boundaries and how to view sex, honestly having come out of such a situation and not being in a committed relationship, I feel like I should just not be thinking about sex at all ideally.

It guided me and my friend down a dirt road, then when we lost sight of it and started looking around, we saw two eyes, with light shining through them. It was beautiful. Then the eyes led us further down the road to this hill, where we saw images in the clouds. A shadow figure running from a weeping angel, four faces, a white horse, an elephant head and an ark. Then my friend wanted to turn around and go back, because he had a bad feeling. Then a voice told him that two people from our campsite weren't there. They weren't, they came out of the woods a minute after he heard that. Then one of them said they saw the eye too, and when we turned around it looked angry, and he later said he didnt actually see the eye, which we figured was the reason it looked angry. Later I saw the elephant head in AA, where I'd formed my closest relationship with God.

Several women have come reporting that he misled them and they were having sex. Even women that are not from the church. 

I am just so confused, because the main message of this man was holiness. How does that even make sense. I know that God is still God , and His word remains true but I feel so silly because I had turned down so many guys because of this no sex before marriage thing that I had decided to try out due to the teachings of this man. 

A lot of people from that church are left hurt and confused, and many have wowed to never go to church especially a few of the girls that were misled by this man. 

Also , there was a fundraising for the church building, which we reached the fundraising goal over £100k. So he probably took the money.

1ggmw9k,October 31st -- Martin Luther and the other Reformers of the Church. Their life and doctrine in brief.,TheRedLionPassant,2024-10-31 19:31:17+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ggmw9k/october_31st_martin_luther_and_the_other/,2,/r/Christianity/comments/1ggmw9k/october_31st_martin_luther_and_the_other/,Christianity,"All Hallows' Eve is the date of the start of the Reformation.  The Reformation was an attempt by several theologiains, many of them priests or bishops, to reform and restore the Church of God back to a more pristine state, free from errors and accretions which it had accumulated throughout the Middle Ages.  It was not an attempt to leave the Church or found a new one.

The Reformers themselves differed in terms of theology, but they all agree with one consent on some essential truths:

- That there is one God, in a Trinity of equal Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

- That Jesus Christ, the only Son of the eternal Father, became incarnate in the flesh, was born of the Virgin Mary and died upon the cross for an atonement of men to reconcile us to the Father.

- That he arose from death, ascended into heaven, and will return to judge all men.

- That the Holy Ghost is given to guide the Christian believers on earth.

- That there is one catholic Church of God, which is found throughout the world, that its ministers may preach the Gospel and administer the Sacraments.

- That all chief ministers and pastors are of equal rank, with none infallibly set over the others, and that the Key of Peter is given to all pastors of the Church who confess her true doctrine.

- That Holy Scripture, being composed under the inspiration of God, contains the source and seed of all Christian doctrine as pertaining to our salvation.

- That the Holy Sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist are those given by Christ to his ministers to perform.

- That our salvation is freely given of God's grace, and received in our hearts by our faith, which is our justification and not based on any merits or deservings on our part.

- That Christ is the one Mediator between God and man, and that we sinners cannot be freed from sin but through him.

- That superstitious ceremonies should be abolished, and corruption in the Church condemned.

- That we who are saved are received into eternal life upon our death, to await the resurrection of the dead and the restoral of creation.

""These things,"" says Bishop John Jewel, in his *Apology*, ""we learned from Christ, the Apostles, and the Holy Fathers, and do sincerely and conscientiously teach the same to the people, for which reason we are now styled 'heretics'. Good God! Have then Christ himself, the Apostles, and so many Fathers, altogether erred? Have Origen, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, Gelasius, and Theodoret all been deserters of the Catholick Faith? Was so great a consent of so many ancient Bishops and learned men nothing else but a conspiracy of hereticks? Or is that which was laudable in them, now condemned in us?""

And now, the lives of the main Reformers:

[John Wycliffe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Wycliffe_by_Kirby.jpg) - English priest, 1328 – 1384, the 'Morning Star' of the Reformation.  Wycliffe was a professor at the University of Oxford, laboured for a vernacular Bible, and condemned the corruption of popes and clergy common in his day.  Wycliffe condemned the selling of indulgences.

[John Hus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Jan_Hus_2.jpg/800px-Jan_Hus_2.jpg) - Bohemian priest and martyr, 1370 – 1415.  The bridge between Wycliffe and Luther, Hus condemned corruption and wealth in the clergy and even the papacy.  Burned at the stake on charges of heresy.

[Martin Luther](https://www.meisterdrucke.ie/kunstwerke/1260px/Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder_-_Martin_Luther_1483-1546_at_the_Age_of_50_1533_-_%28MeisterDrucke-727001%29.jpg) - German priest and monk, 1483 – 1546.  A man who needs no introduction.  Luther was a theology professor who attacked the selling of indulgences.  In time he became convinced that we were saved not for merit but through faith (something he struggled with in his early life and career).  Laboured to create a vernacular Bible.  

[Philip Melanchthon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Portrait_of_Philipp_Melanchthon_%281497%E2%80%931560%29%2C_by_Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder_-_Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie_Alte_Meister%2C_Kassel.jpg) - German theologian, 1497 – 1560.  A professor at Luther's university and a Greek scholar, Melanchthon helped Luther in his translation of the Bible.  He corresponded with Reformers in other countries.

[Ulrich Zwingli](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Ulrich-Zwingli-1.jpg) - Swiss priest, 1484 – 1531.  Zwingli was a contemporary of Luther, and as the head priest of the Church of Zurich began the Reformation in Switzerland.  Zwingli held to many of Luther's ideas but disagreed on the nature of the Eucharist.  His successors would help to heal this rift.  Zwingli's ideas were more radical than Luther's and he influenced the Reformed traditions.

[Henry Bullinger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Heinrich_Bullinger.jpg) - Swiss priest, 1504 – 1575, successor to Zwingli as head pastor of the Zurich Church.  Bullinger was mindful of the rift between Luther and Zwingli and sought to articulate some of Zwingli's doctrines on the Lord's Supper more clearly.  Bullinger authored confessions to this effect, and collaborated with other Reformers in Switzerland.

[John Calvin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/John_Calvin_Museum_Catharijneconvent_RMCC_s84_cropped.png/800px-John_Calvin_Museum_Catharijneconvent_RMCC_s84_cropped.png) - French priest, 1509 – 1564.  Calvin belonged to the second generation of Reformers (he was only a child when Luther began his career), and studied at Paris and Orleans in both theology and law.  Becoming convinced by the writings of Luther and Zwingli, Calvin was forced to flee his native France for Switzerland, where he settled in Geneva and became its head pastor.  He collaborated with Bullinger at Zurich on matters of theology, and the two came to agreements on the nature of the Eucharist.  Calvin is best known for his commentaries on the Bible as well as his 'scholastic' and intellectual approach to theology, in contrast to the mysticism of Luther.

[Theodore Beza](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Th%C3%A9odore_de_B%C3%A8ze_1577_Gen%C3%A8ve.jpg/800px-Th%C3%A9odore_de_B%C3%A8ze_1577_Gen%C3%A8ve.jpg) - French theologian, 1519 – 1605, and Calvin's successor at Geneva.  In addition to his writings, Beza is known to have opened Geneva to Protestant refugees from other nations.  He sat as an instrumental figure in the Academy of Geneva, which trained pastors and scholars.

[William Tyndale](https://www.plough.com/-/media/images/plough/article/2016/spring/tyndale/tyndaleembed.jpg?h=697&w=600&la=en) - English priest and scholar, and also martyr, 1494 – 1536.  Tyndale was influenced by the writings of Wycliffe and Luther.  A gifted student at Oxford, he became fluent in multiple languages and sought to translate the Bible into the vernacular.  Strangled and burned on charges of heresy.

[Martin Bucer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Martin_Bucer_by_German_School.jpg) - German former monk, 1491 – 1551.  Bucer was well-connected and corresponded between his native Germany, Switzerland and England.  He sought to reconcile the differences between the followers of Luther and Zwingli, and had a friendship with Calvin.  He favoured simplicity in worship and faith, and sought common causes between different Protestant factions.  His influence can be seen in the Lutheran, Reformed and Anglican traditions.

[John Lasco](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Johannes_a_Lasco.JPG) - Polish pastor, 1499 – 1560.  Lasco did a lot of work in advancing the Reformed tradition in his native Poland, owing to his admiration of Zwingli and Calvin.  He also did a lot of work in England, where he led a church in London, and was influential on the Reformation there.

[Peter Martyr Vermigli](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Pietro_Vermigli_by_Hans_Asper.jpg/1200px-Pietro_Vermigli_by_Hans_Asper.jpg) - Italian monk and scholar, 1499 – 1562.  Vermigli embraced the ideas of the Reformation after reading Zwingli and Bucer, and was forced to flee his native Italy for Strasbourg, where he taught the Bible under Martin Bucer.  He then left for Oxford and influenced the Eucharistic liturgy of the Church of England.  He was forced to flee when Queen Mary I took the throne, and continued his work at Zurich.  He was a leading authority on the Eucharist and the theology of the Lord's Supper.

[Thomas Cranmer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Thomas_Cranmer_by_Gerlach_Flicke.jpg/1200px-Thomas_Cranmer_by_Gerlach_Flicke.jpg) - English archbishop and martyr, 1489 – 1556.  Heavily influenced by the Reformation in Germany and Switzerland, Cranmer was promoted by the family of Anne Boleyn to chaplain, eventually landing himself a position as the Archbishop of Canterbury and godfather to the future king, Edward VI.  In King Edward's reign, Cranmer reformed the Church of England, introducing new articles of faith and a new liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer.  Burned at the stake under Mary I on charges of heresy.

[Hugh Latimer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Hugh_Latimer_from_NPG.jpg) - English bishop and martyr, 1487 – 1555.  A man who sought to reform the Church of England, Latimer was bold in rebuking vice and in promoting a vernacular Bible.  Burned at the stake on charges of heresy.

[Nicholas Ridley](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Nicholas_Ridley_from_NPG.jpg) - English bishop and martyr, 1500 – 1555.  Ridley helped Cranmer in authoring the reformed liturgy, and also argued for the catholic lineage of the Reformed faith, maintaining many traditions such as priestly vestments.  Burned at the stake alongside Latimer.

[Jerome Zanchi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Hieronymus_Zanchius.jpg/800px-Hieronymus_Zanchius.jpg) - Italian priest and scholar, 1516 – 1590.  Zanchi was a systematic theologian in the tradition of Aquinas, much like Calvin was, and continued much of Calvin's legacy after his death.

[Martin Chemnitz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Martin-Chemnitz.jpg) - German pastor and theologian, 1522 – 1586, called 'the Second Martin'.  Chemnitz continued Luther's legacy and is largely responsible for articulating much of Luther's thought in a more clear and concise way.

[John Knox](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Portrait_of_John_Knox_%284671577%29.jpg) - Scottish clergyman, 1514 – 1572.  Knox studied under Calvin at Geneva, and was influential in reforming the Church of Scotland.  The Presbyterian style of church owes much to Knox.  He produced the Book of Common Order as a liturgical text for use in the Scottish Church.

[William Perkins](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/British_-_William_Perkins_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) - English clergyman and theologian at Cambridge, 1558–1602.  Perkins is influential in the development of the 'Puritan' strain of the Church of England.  Unlike other Puritans, however, Perkins strove for catholicity and conformity to the doctrines and authority of the Church.

[John Jewel](https://npgshop.org.uk/cdn/shop/products/default_5701457d-7846-438b-865b-ee75e0d43f6a.jpg?v=1669306367) - English bishop and scholar, 1522 – 1571.  Jewel studied under Vermigli and was forced to flee for Strasbourg and Zurich upon the accession of Queen Mary.  Under Elizabeth he returned to England and became a bishop at Salisbury, authoring treatises on the Sacraments and an Apology for the Reformed Church of England.  He also authored many homilies and continued Cranmer's work and legacy.

[Richard Hooker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Richard_Hooker_%28State_1%29.jpg/800px-Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Richard_Hooker_%28State_1%29.jpg) - English priest and scholar, 1554 – 1600.  Hooker is best known for his articulation of Anglican theology, which relies upon Scripture, reason and tradition.

I can’t believe that I am at a point in life that death would seem to be far preferable than the miserable existence I’m living. I couldn’t imagine I would ever consider death as a blessing. Or simply a way to find relief. 

How can God love me and yet allow me to suffer with no one to care or even notice I’m drowning. I just ate the last meal I had money for tonight. Maybe tomorrow I’ll have to hold a sign being a beggar on a street corner. I’m probably too clean cut to get any help though.

Basically the baby was not going to live. 0% chance of survival, but because of abortion laws in Texas they could not intervene to save the life of the mother and she died as a result. THEY say it's God's will which seems pretty convenient. First of all the Bible makes no mention of abortion and we could discuss the things it says about the unborn and children another time, but wouldn't God have created the doctors and gifted them with the skills to save her life? Why would God then turn around and say, ""Don't, let her suffer and let her die""? Republicans are making it out like she did something wrong for getting pregnant and  this is her punishment from God. 

I am always reminded in these cases about that joke about the guy stuck on his roof in the flood telling everyone God will save him. In this case the help was literally there, but stupid laws based on someone's WRONG interpretation of the Bible directly-caused her death. ",276,True,News,news,0.77,False,News

I used to practice witchcraft and perform hexes that unfortunately worked. I will get into that later if asked. However I never really accepted the idea of a god. However there is just to much we can’t explain and if anything in the universe were a hair off none of us would be here. I will attach what I have gathered below and I hope anyone also looking for answers sees this.


1. Fine-Tuning of the Universe and the Big Bang as Evidence of a Creator

	•	Definition of Fine-Tuning and the Role of the Big Bang: The fine-tuning of the universe refers to the precise conditions that make life possible. These include fundamental constants like gravity, the cosmological constant, and nuclear forces, all of which were set in motion at the universe’s inception, often associated with the Big Bang.
	•	The Big Bang Theory and the Universe’s Beginning: The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began from an infinitely dense point approximately 13.8 billion years ago, expanding rapidly in a process that created space, time, and all matter. This aligns with the idea of a definitive beginning for the universe—a moment of creation—supporting the possibility of an intentional Creator setting everything into motion.
	•	Biblical Correlation: The Bible describes a clear beginning to the universe, initiated by God:
	•	Genesis 1:1: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” This opening statement resonates with the idea that everything, including space and time, originated from a single act of creation, which aligns with the Big Bang as a moment of cosmic birth.
	•	Hebrews 11:3: “By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.” This suggests that the universe was created from nothing—mirroring scientific descriptions of the Big Bang as the origin of all matter and energy.
	•	Fine-Tuning as Purposeful Design: The Big Bang set precise conditions, such as the expansion rate of the universe. A slight alteration could have led to a universe that either collapsed back on itself or expanded too fast for galaxies to form. The improbability of these conditions happening by chance aligns with the view of a Creator orchestrating the universe’s creation with purposeful intent.

2. God as Light and Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)

	•	Prevalence of NDEs and Experience of Light: Surveys show that 10-20% of people who survive a life-threatening event report a near-death experience. A large portion describe encountering a brilliant, peaceful light, which they interpret as a divine presence or glimpse of the afterlife.
	•	Scriptural Depictions of God as Light: The Bible often describes God as light, symbolizing purity, truth, and divine presence:
	•	1 John 1:5: “God is light; in him, there is no darkness at all.” This portrayal of God as perfect, all-encompassing light resonates with the peaceful light reported in NDEs.
	•	Revelation 21:23: Describing Heaven, it says, “The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light.” This vision of eternal light aligns with the experiences of people who have reported encounters with a peaceful, radiant presence during NDEs.
	•	Connection Between NDEs and Faith in a Creator: The widespread and consistent accounts of a divine light in NDEs provide many with a personal conviction of a Creator and the existence of an afterlife. This experience of light aligns with biblical descriptions of God’s presence, reinforcing belief in a divine source behind life.

3. Biblical Support for the Existence of Spiritual Realms Beyond the Physical

	•	The Bible frequently refers to spiritual realms or dimensions beyond the material world, suggesting that existence includes more than just the visible universe:
	•	2 Corinthians 12:2-4: Paul speaks of “a man… caught up to the third heaven,” implying multiple dimensions of Heaven beyond what is visible to us.
	•	Ephesians 6:12: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against… the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” This reference implies realms or dimensions of spiritual existence outside our physical perception.
	•	Scientific Views on Dimensions: Theoretical physics, particularly string theory, proposes additional dimensions beyond the observable four (three spatial dimensions plus time). This idea of unseen dimensions aligns with the concept of spiritual realms, suggesting that Heaven, Hell, or other spiritual planes could exist in dimensions we cannot physically observe.

4. Theological Implications of Fine-Tuning, the Big Bang, and NDEs

	•	Fine-Tuning and the Big Bang as Evidence of a Creator: The precise conditions established at the moment of the Big Bang suggest purposeful design. The Bible describes creation as an intentional act by God:
	•	Isaiah 45:18: “For this is what the Lord says—he who created the heavens… he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.” This passage implies that God designed the universe specifically to support life.
	•	Romans 1:20: “For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities… have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.” Paul emphasizes that the intricacies of creation reveal the divine qualities of God, supporting the belief in a Creator.
	•	NDEs and Personal Conviction of the Afterlife: With a significant percentage of people experiencing NDEs, often involving a peaceful, all-encompassing light, these accounts provide experiential evidence for many of a Creator and a spiritual realm beyond this life. This widespread phenomenon aligns with the idea that life is not random but intentionally crafted by a Creator, offering a glimpse of the divine through personal experiences.

In summary, the Big Bang’s alignment with the Bible’s depiction of creation, the precision of fine-tuning in the universe, and the prevalence of peaceful light experiences in NDEs all provide compelling reasons to believe in a Creator. Together, these elements suggest that life and the universe are the results of intentional design, pointing to a higher power behind existence and a spiritual reality beyond our physical world.



Note: I was researching until midnight about if god really does exist and comparing scripture to science and physical events we can compare to.Now this is not based on anything scientific but I wanted to tell someone. I live in my recently deceased grandmothers home and we have lived there over two years without any incidents. However after staying up past 3am looking into this and taking notes I finally decided to go to bed. The next morning when getting up for work my partner informed me I had been screaming the word “Grandma” repeatedly like I had been looking for her. I don’t  remember any of this and I don’t really dream or sleep talk to begin with.As of now the date is 10/31/2024. It is a very spooky coincidence and I feel like I’m having a midlife crisis and a calling almost to research more I haven’t been to church in over ten years since childhood but there is just to much.

1ggqqw3,Unequal Yoke,klajaan,2024-10-31 22:22:56+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ggqqw3/unequal_yoke/,1,/r/Christianity/comments/1ggqqw3/unequal_yoke/,Christianity,"Hi! I’m a non-believer.

I’m 27 years old and have been a non-believer since I was 12. One day, I just questioned why there *must* be a God, and that idea has stayed with me ever since. I'm not hostile toward Christianity, though. The reason I'm writing here is that I’m looking for advice.

Six months ago, my Christian girlfriend and I broke up after five years together. We’re both the same age (she’s born in January, I’m in September). We had planned to get married in the next two years according to Christian customs, and she wanted to raise our future children as Christians. I accepted this since faith is important to her, though I wasn’t planning to go to church every Sunday because I'm not a believer. However, I was willing to attend special events like Christmas. At first, she agreed to this, but it wasn’t ideal for her.

Beyond our beliefs, we had a few other issues that arose in those final four months. She ultimately decided to end things because she thought that staying together might lead to a big fight, and ending things while we still loved each other would be easier. We cried a lot together, and she asked if we could still be friends. I’m in love, so I agreed.

But in reality, we didn’t become true friends – we were more like an ""almost couple"" without the kisses. We’d still hug, kiss each other on the cheek, hold hands occasionally, and comfort each other. Three months after we broke up, we kissed. I love her deeply, so it was wonderful, but we both knew it was a mistake. After that, she distanced herself a little and stopped flirting, though we still spent a lot of time together and shared those intimate, caring gestures.

When I asked her why she’d pulled away, she explained that staying in this in-between state was painful for her, so she needed some space. It hurt to hear that, but I understood. (I should also add that, after our breakup, she started going to more activities at her church.)

Currently, we’re still in this same space – we spend a lot of time together, she looks at me and speaks to me like a girlfriend would, and we still hug and share little affectionate gestures. I’ve realized that she’s the love of my life; I love her with all my heart, and she’s the most beautiful and kind woman I’ve ever met. I want to be with her.

However, she’s told me that she’s become friends with a guy in her church’s young adult group, and of course, I felt jealous. But I believe her when she says they’re just friends because she knows I’m still in love with her, and I trust she wouldn’t hurt me that way. Despite all of this, when I tell her I still love her and want to spend my life with her, she doesn’t really respond. She just listens, hugs me, and says it’s normal to feel this way – but her actions seem to show that she still loves me too.

And through all of this, I’ve been working on my thesis and searching for a job, so these past months have been incredibly difficult.

So here’s my question: I wonder if she’d consider getting back together if I converted to Christianity. But I know I can’t do that sincerely; it would be selfish and insincere, and she deserves a partner who’s genuinely Christian, someone who can fully share her faith. My heart breaks to think that I’m not that person. Maybe I should let her go so she can meet the right man – the one she truly deserves – even though she’s the love of my life.

This is really just a way for me to share my situation, and I’m curious to know what a Christian perspective might be on all this.

I just happened to see a video with them on it, and I really miss having them in my neighborhood. I always wondered what denomination of Christian they were because I'd like to learn more about it. Any guesses from these clues?

1. 10+ kids all homeschooled
2. The kids tended to get married at age 16 to other homeschooled Christian kids. This was before a law was passed making it illegal to marry before 18 in Minnesota. They seemed to start having kids right away after getting married. Some of them chose not to get married that young, though.
3. At their weddings, the boys would carry long swords and the girls could carry short daggers.
4. Some of the kids were really into weaponry. One would practice using a whip in the front yard all the time. He knew a lot about swords and guns. They would do sword fighting in a more serious way (like choreographed) as opposed to just boys playing around. I wasn't sure if the family had more of a survivalist/doomsday mentality or maybe it was just an out of the ordinary interest for the kids.
5. Even though they lived in Minnesota, they seemed to have a lot of connections down south. Some of them later moved to Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
6. I rarely saw them with shoes on outdoors, even in the winter walking on snow. I thought maybe this was a way to save money since they didn't seem to have a lot, but I've read some Christians like being barefoot because of a passage regarding Moses walking barefoot on sacred ground.
7. They dressed very modestly. The girls wore long dresses and the boys always had their t-shirts tucked in.
8. They did trick or treating (i.e. they didn't have a problem with it).
9. They were able to watch at least some secular entertainment like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
10. They had signs supporting conservative politicians.
11. Multiple kids helped build Ark Encounter in Kentucky (They lived in Minnesota but went down there to help).",8,True,,,1.0,False,

Almost every couple of weeks, there is some scandal with some well known pastor having done something stupidly morally wrong - usually involving money and women. 

That is indicative, however, of so many issues going on in normal peoples' lives. The stats of pornography use among Christians, for example, is pretty much equal to the stats on other people. 

It's my opinion that there is something faulty here. We can't be idealistic, but it doesn't seem like any form of Christianity can provide a proper answer as to why human beings, after coming to Christ, can still do atrocious things and not stop. No one seems to provide a clear answer as to how to stop. 

I've heard it all. I understand how the Catholics view sanctification; Calvinists; Arminians; Wesleyans; Lutherans. I understand the East's idea of deification. They all seem to say similar things, yet worded differently, and it seems something is missing, as the results just aren't there. It's not like the scandals just revolve around Baptists, for instance, but they cross denominational and theological lines. 

In my life, the results I want aren't there either. I can try the whole ""results don't matter"" approach and that I'm justified by Christ and not my works, and I agree with that, but yet these sins still ruin my life and quality of life. I want them gone, and they won't go, despite all the prayer in the world. 

I can try the ""we live in a fallen world"" approach. Sure, I get that. But yet, some of the things we do - or think - can be deeply disturbing. 

When I look at the New Testament, I know the Corinthians were being dumbasses, but yet we have Peter and Paul and while they made mistakes, it's not like they seemed to be struggling with money or lust or these things that can really destroy a person.

Maybe I just have OCD. But I'm sure there is something missing in our belief system. I'm asking here because who knows? Maybe someone out there has gone on a similar journey and actually found out what's wrong - and what to do about it.",13,True,,,1.0,False,

Me and him came to the faith for different reasons but at a similar time about a year and a half ago. I thought that was amazing as my best friend is now of the same faith as me and we could continue our journey and strengthen our faith together (Matthew 18:20).

He has started taking his journey a bit more seriously than I have, reading more and going to church. He has completely changed himself for the better from what I've seen. I have always wanted that for myself as well. I love for him. 

Unfortunately slowly and surely he has become more distant from me. He doesn't answer my calls or ever wants to hangout. He rarely if not never reaches out to see how I'm doing. It seems when we do talk at work our conversations not the same anymore and he talks to me in a way to where it seems he's above me (just my opinion). I can't really explain it, but you probably know what I mean when you've had your friend around for 8 years. 

I confronted him about this and we had a chat not too long ago. He claims he's on his journey and that because of my sin or that I live in sin he doesn't want to be around me. 
The sin in question is mainly player poker. I play it around 4 times a week with friends at a kava bar. I rarely go out and stay on my computer so I find it a way to be social but also to play a game I love. I'm not 100% sure if I have an ""addiction"" but it is definitely something I like to do. I feel as if just this alone is not a good reason to cut off a big relationship you have with someone.

He claims because I play this game and I do not feel bad about it or seek forgiveness for it that he doesn't want to be around me. He proceeded to pull out about 6 different lines of scripture about how brothers shouldn't be around each other if one sins or that we need to be sharpening each others faith which I can't do because of my sin. Even though some of this scripture said to keep your brothers close at heart and to save him, he basically ignored that part. 

I don't want to lose my friend this way and it makes me have contradicting thoughts about my faith. 

One way I feel like christianity stole him from me and he's gone too far to where he is ""one of those judgmental christians"". The other side of me tells me I need to be happy for him thats he's made the progress he did and that I need to catch up. I don't want Jesus to be the reason that I lose my friend when I try everyday to have faith in him.

I am looking for advice here on how to think about this. I am very lost and will be praying for wisdom and strength for this problem. I really don't want to lose my best friend.

TL:DR - I lost my best friend of the same faith because of his opinions via the bible and now doesn't want to be my friend because I play poker.

Limited social skills. Very hard for me to make friends much less leave my apartment and meet people due to crippling social anxiety (like it is so bad I dissociate and have panic attacks, it isn't as simple of a matter as ""just putting myself out there"") as a result I never dated or got married. It is very likely I am never going to find anyone to marry as I also have attachment problems. I have made a cozy little life for myself and like it that way, but unfortunately having autism does not take away the fact that I am a sexual being like any other normal 31-year old woman. 

I know marriage is not a free ticket to all the sex you want, but it is traumatizing having sexual feelings and urges as an older woman that I am supposed to ""pray away"" or shame myself for because I am single. I have struggled with self-loathing just for having a sexual thought since I was a teenager after going through purity culture lessons at youth group and from reading articles online.

As I entered my mid 20s my sex drive started getting really strong, like so strong I have physical pains if I don't relieve myself. If I don't relieve myself I have explicit sexual dreams that make me feel horrible. It is becoming clear to me that turning off my feelings and being asexual is not possible, no matter how hard I have prayed and begged God. I used to hate my body and my feelings. I get scared I am going to hell or that God will kill or punish someone I love if I masturbate or think about sex. This has traumatized me so much it grieves me now that I realize how messed up it all is. 

I don't want a hook-up. I don't want to have sex just because. I want a loving relationship with someone who I trust and feel strong feelings for. I am celibate for this reason and refuse to give in, so please do not suggest I become an atheist and go to the nearest male stripper club. That is off the table. I refuse to give up my faith in Jesus because of this problem that I know has to have a solution. 

All my life I grew up believing that sex and anything sexual related is off-limits until marriage. Even thinking about sex. I colored myself as a filthy person as a teen because I thought about sex often. 

I believe some adverse childhood experiences may have had a role in my issue. When I was 10 years old I was crawling on my brother's bedroom floor because I was going to jump up and scare him and my mom walked in and got **livid** thinking I was doing sex dances and locked me in my bedroom and put a chair over the door and told my dad to not let me out. I also remember having a dream about sex and going to my mom about it because I wanted to talk about it and she got really upset and kicked a box across the room. 

And yes, I have seen a therapist for my sexual shame. The therapist told me that I am perfectly normal and should not feel ashamed. This did not help me very much because I could tell the conversation made the air uncomfortable and naturally we didn't delve too deeply into it so I just gave up. 

I don't know how God wants me to view my sexuality. Obviously, He created sex and sexuality. He designed me this way. He knew I would have these intense feelings of longing and wanting to connect sexually with someone. I don't think I will ever be in a position to meet someone and connect with them enough to have them want to marry me. Does He really want me to hate myself and force any sexual thought out from my head until I have a ring on my finger? Am I abnormal?

What are developmentally delayed, autistic, mentally ill or socially inept people who sadly most likely will never find a spouse supposed to do with their sexuality if they never get married?

Ever since I learned what the context says it is “attributing works of Satan to Jesus” I’ve been having intrusive thoughts about it to the point where during watching a YouTube video of someone saying Jesus met them when their car flipped x4 times and I said mentally “that was Satan” I corrected the thought saying no that wasn’t Satan and it was like I had to consciously decide to reaffirm what I know to be true and try to convince my mind of the truth I knew. The thoughts got so uncomfortable I decided to stop watching the video because I didn’t like them.

The next day came and I was still wondering if I committed the sin so I kept doing research about it and spinning out emotional to the point I did something even worse and mentally said “I don’t care if I blasphemed the Holy Spirit” but then turned around right after to remind consciously decide to remind myself I do. I just wanted relief from the constant torment I had been facing the days prior. 

Then I woke up the day after and continued the same cycle of doing research feeling like I was more of a rational mind and trying to find the answers I stumbled across a question where someone asked a person on this thread “do you believe Jesus is a demon?” I know he isn’t but the answer yes came to my brain and then once again I said no against the thought because I know in my heart he isn’t. 

Here’s my thing. 

I’ve said the things in my head. In my heart and sane state of mind I don’t believe those to be true.

I accepted Christ long before this and believed he was exactly who he said he was and never once had a thought that he or the Holy Spirit were evil or demons or did demonic works at my time of accepting him.

it seems like ever since I’ve learned of the definition and began fearing I committed the sin I’ve now mentally had utterances of me saying it in context to how it says a person who commits it commits it.

I don’t understand why I’d say the things in my mind if I know they aren’t true. I know I didn’t say them believing it in my heart or being convicted against the truth I know. 

What do you make of this?? 

Have I psyched myself out into saying & having these thoughts because I’ve overly analyzed my thoughts and kept the definition in my mind",13,True,,,0.99,False,

For generations, Satan has sought to disengage Believers from the Truth.  His success ratio has been alarming.  People are swayed by personalities.  Just as the secular world has been mesmerized by such personalities as actors, athletes, and other socially prominent individuals, the Church has elevated many pastors to celebrity status.  The marketing of these pastors has created mega-churches.  People seem to be drawn to the personality rather than to the Lord.  Jesus said that the only way to the Father was through Him. (John 14:6)  It is becoming more and more evident that the way to encounter God is through personalities.

 Literally, tens of thousands of people flock to these churches to hear dynamic, charismatic speakers expound the Word.  Many of these churches literally have people lined up hours before the scheduled services to get a seat. 

Something is wrong if people are more attached to the messenger than the message.  John the Baptizer said, “He (Jesus) must increase, but I must decrease.” (John 3:30)  When a pastor becomes the center of attention, something is wrong.  When a celebrity pastor lives a lifestyle above his parishioners, something is wrong.  Jesus said, “You shall know them (false prophets) by their fruits.” (Matthew 7:16)  What is alarming is that Christians are more excited about eating the offered fruit than examining the fruit.  Failing to hold a pastor accountable to the Word is a dangerous omission.    Many churches draw people into their gates with little regard for their individual growth.  Numbers, in every form, are what counts.  **Something is wrong when there is more concern to fill seats than hearts.**

I believe Satan has infiltrated many pulpits with his shepherds.  They preach the initial Truth, but their intent is to eventually commit Biblical infidelity.  Their purpose is to gently alter the Word.  Slowly and methodically the Scriptures are being dissembled.   Entertainment draws people to their misguided goals.  These shepherds promote self-dependence instead of God dependence and feelings instead of Faith.  Jesus warned about wolves in sheep's clothing. 

Some churches are staffed by Christian men dedicated to assisting the people in a growing and lasting experience with Jesus Christ.  The problem arises when success becomes greater than the purpose of the ministry.  Many meg-church pastors have built their churches around themselves and not on the One they are to serve.  Some have taken their beliefs even to Biblical inaccuracy to keep their churches growing.  Homosexuality, same-sex marriage, pastoral gender, and Biblical inerrancy have crept into some of the largest churches in the world.  God will not be mocked.  In the last few years many celebrity pastors and their ministries have been exposed, leaving their followers confused and wounded.  The great danger facing the Church today is shepherds that are in the service of a different lord and, and shepherds whose egos have gone unchecked.

Moral of the story is not only living in this society extremely difficult but being a real Christian is as well. 
I am constantly having to switch jobs and admittedly have no social life. Constantly dealing with rude and door slamming neighbors who constantly complain they hate me when usually I barely make any noise. The reality of being a Christian and seeing those who make a living off showing that they are “Christian” is having to accept the fact that most, but not all, have sold out. I just honestly don’t know what to do, because I am praying but even the churches I go to are not safe. The Holy Spirit is well alarming, the places where I work and the amount of spiritual warfare is definitely doing a number on me. It’s so jarringly strange the fact that when I express my love of GOD after others express the love of their idols, shows, items, sexual preferences Im looked at like I just talked about the most recent crime scene. Ultimately getting alienated, and kicked out from any social chatting in the group. I’m tired of holding it together, this may be a test from GOD, and honestly the Heavenly Father is the only one who is helping me to hold it together.

3. Buddha borned as a human and studied the nature of mind-matter(existence). Jesus came from different angelic dimension and wants to help people understand the will of the creator (The god)

No?

Me neither. 

As far as I can tell, my Christian commitments make me “not Democrat” and expressly require me to vote against such views. That means voting for Trump, in this election.  

It makes me pro-life, pro-family, pro-traditional marriage, anti-LGBTQ ideology (which is the loving and truthful position). Among others, these are all Christian positions, not just political positions.

In this particular election, all the various, complex issues considered, a vote for Trump (who I do not endorse) seems like the right choice. While one could abstain, hoping for better future options, it seems to me that doing so pretty much guarantees you won’t ever see better options. 

I know many people will think I’m an idiot or moral fool for saying this. While I don’t think the same of them, I do think this is the right move for Christians. Nor, if I can anticipate a rebuttal do I think that “love your neighbor” is consistent with the democratic position on ANY issue, including unfettered immigration, which Democrat leaders seem to be using to change the electorate while not actually caring much about immigrants or citizens. Remember Martha’s Vineyard? Consider even the restrictions on immigration baked into the laws God gave Israel. Compassion within the context of wisdom. 

If my fellow Christians disagree I hope they can do so without becoming rabid haters. Either way, the choice seems abundantly clear to me, for whatever that’s worth to you. I’m voting for Trump, as much as I don’t like it.”

I want to start off by saying I respect Christianity and I don't mean to offend anyone. I merely have a few questions about the religion as a former Christian. 

1. Why would the God of Christianity allow the majority of humanity to go straight to hell? 
To be allowed to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, someone would have to accept Jesus as their lord and savior, and would have to accept him as the messiah. What about people who never got the chance to learn about Christianity, or people who never had any competent people to explain why Christianity is correct, and what about people who did good deeds but never considered themselves Christian?

2. On a similar but different topic, are people who claim to be spiritual without Christianity wrong? Jews, Hindus, African Traditionalists etc, all claim to have some type of connection to the divine. They pray to God/ the Gods and seemingly get responses the same way Christians do. Their prayers are seemingly answered regardless of their religion, so why do we automatically assume Christianity is the correct religion? 

3. If God is all knowing, then why does he need to test us? I get that we are given free will, but isn't God aware of what we will ultimately choose to believe in? If he does know, why would he create the souls of people who are set to burn in hell?

4. Why is Jesus considered the messiah? From what I understand the messiah is supposed to rebuild the Temple, return the Jews from the diaspora and establish a Kingdom based on torah law. As far as I am aware, Jesus did not do any of those things.

5. Jesus apparently claimed that the apocalypse was supposed to occur within the lifetime of his disciples. How could God get a prediction wrong?

6. Why would God allow great civilizations like India and China to persist without making them turn to Christianity? They are arguably the two most successful civilizations to ever exist, so why would God allow them so much success if Christianity was correct?

It basically argues that while we know the Earth revolves around the Sun scientifically, **from a metaphysical perspective**, the universe can be construed as revolving around the Earth. 

The argument is based on the idea that there's no universal frame of reference in the universe. Everything is relative. If you're on a planet and a spaceship is moving away from you, the planet is moving away from the spaceship, just as the spaceship is moving away from the planet. It's all about where you place the observer.

And since Earth is the only known place with observers (life and consciousness), the argument is that everything in the universe can be seen as revolving around it from our perspective. Even the people on the Intentional Space Station are basically still on Earth.

I have been surrounding myself with loved ones and have been staying busy through work and the gym. I want to learn myself more and get closer to God through this process. My friend and I had a long conversation 4 days ago where we discussed our faith and it gave me a noticeable difference in comfort.

although my heart is still hurting, My mind is aware of the situation and how “it wasn’t my fault” as I truly did want this to last but her actions implied she did not. I am finding peace with this mindset. 

All off this being said, I am unsure how I should move forward with God in mind. Last night, I was with some buddies and they recommended I get on Hinge. I did and I felt horrible after it. I guess I am wondering how to feel about it and how to move forward in this regard.

TLDR: Went through a bad breakup but moving past it through faith love and reason rather quickly. Got on Hinge and I am wondering how I should feel and move forward with God in mind. Looking for advice as I have never been in a situation like this.",4,True,Advice,advice,1.0,False,Advice

1gge4sl,How do you deal with the anxiety and sometimes fear that comes with helping disadvantaged and often mentally ill people?,Zodo12,2024-10-31 13:10:14+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gge4sl/how_do_you_deal_with_the_anxiety_and_sometimes/,2,/r/Christianity/comments/1gge4sl/how_do_you_deal_with_the_anxiety_and_sometimes/,Christianity,"I'm in my early twenties.   

I've begun volunteering at my church's soup kitchen/cafe which gives free food to the needy a few times a week. The thing is, theologically I am very fixated on ""good works"" and actually going out and helping poor and vulnerable people. To the extent that I want to become a minister and dedicate my life to it.  

But I'm also someone with quite thin skin, and I take things personally sometimes. Today there was a very large, intimidating man with head tattoos who came in for some food. He had an altercation with another man which almost resulted in a fight, but we calmed him down somewhat. I offered to get him some dessert to take away to be nice to him. He was still aggravated, but accepted the offer. It was my first time in a new kitchen and I was being a bit slow plating it up and finding the right items. He kept getting more and more riled up and annoyed at me until I gave him the food and he left.   

Now, this is obviously a really minor incident. But it's left me with a big pit in my stomach - I'm not very good with confrontation and a situation like this tends to make me want to curl up into a ball - it took the wind out of my sails.  

In this anxious state, it makes me question my theology, or my place, in the church. Am I meant to help people if I'm so bad with the risk of danger? Am I just not used to it? Is it normal to feel so troubled when dealing with often mentally unstable people in a church environment?

Do you think there is any space alongside Christianity for:

1. Belief in near death experiences;
2. Speaking to, and desiring signs passed, from our loved ones who have passed;
3. Belief in ghosts;
4. Asking mediums for assistance in connecting with loved ones who have passed.

I understand the Bible warns us against using spells or looking for omens or worshipping idols. 

People find consolation for grief and suffering in these types of engagements - and many have very sincere beliefs in their experiences. 

I understand that some will say this is evil and could attract demons. 

Are there any Christians or agnostics here who consider there is any kind of coherence between these practices and Christianity? Would appreciate your views.

2. Trump will end the war in the Middle East and Iran will soon be destroyed
3. Trump will sign an agreement with Israel and the other middle eastern countries. This is what is called the ""Abraham Alliance"".
4. Trump and Putin will enter into an Alliance. The bible calls Putin ""Gog of Magog"". Putin with permission from Trump will then try to invade Israel but Putin will not succeed.
5. Trump will invade Israel himself.
6. Elon Musk will run the entire world alongside Trump as his second in command. This is who the bible calls the ""False Prophet.""
7. Elon Musk will declare Trump as God and everyone on earth will have to worship Trump and get Neuralink or be killed. Billions will die.
8. Elon Musk will introduce Neuralink as the only payment system. This is the mark of the beast. The neuralink logo can be written as the number 47 (This is the number of beast, Trump), a big 4 and a small 7 (look at it closely). Neuralink is also 666 in Greek. The new testament of the bible was written in Greek. MAGA is a latin word for witchcraft and sorcery that is why Elon Musk calls himself DARK MAGA.
9. Very soon millions of Christians will dissappear WORLDWIDE. Jesus will take us to heaven for protection.
10. Over 2 Billion people will die within the next 3 years and over 6 billion deaths within the next 7 years. Jesus called this the GREAT TRIBULATION.
11. All those who take Neuralink will develop huge sores. This will be God's judgement for worshipping Trump and Elon Musk.
12. Moses and Elijah will appear in Jerusalem very soon and preach for 1260 days. When Elijah arrives in Jerusalem he will stop the rain worldwide for 1260 days, Moses will turn water into blood. The Sun will burn people alive, wild animals will go rogue this will all lead to severe drought, famine and hunger and death leading to global deaths in the billions. 
13. Trump will have them killed after 1260 days and the whole world will celebrate cause Elijah had stopped the rain. Trump will refuse to have their bodies buried and they will lie in the street for 3 days after 3 days in the streets of Jerusalem they will rise from the dead and ascend into heaven and there will be a huge earthquake and over 7,000 people will die on the spot.
14. The Jews will refuse to worship Trump and Trump will order the elimination of over 6 million Jews after they refuse to worship him. 3 million Jews will run into the wilderness where they will be protected by Micheal for the last 3 and a half years before Jesus comes back.
15. Everyone who takes Neuralink will go to hell automatically. Jesus can not save you after getting Neuralink. This is the mark of the beast. When Jesus comes back in 2031 everyone who refused to take Neuralink will be saved and everyone who took it will automatically die.
16. The USA will be destroyed and never to be rebuilt again.
17. Between 30 Sept 2031 and 9 October 2031 Jesus Christ will descend from heaven and throw Trump and Elon Musk alive into the Lake of Fire. Satan will be chained and Jesus will rule the world in Jerusalem for 1,000 years until 3031.

So I’ve been sort of struggling/thinking about the morality of God sending Jesus to die for our sins.

Jesus’ sacrifice is like THE most important thing in the entire faith. We take communion, appreciate and acknowledge the blood and it’s a big pillar of the faith. Yet, I feel like it would have been morally wrong to NOT sacrifice himself. 

To create a species that never existed in the first place, that suddenly now exists on earth. This species possesses the capability to sin, and if they do, can be bound to eternal damnation unless these are atoned with a sacrifice.

My thing is, isn’t it only fair that he provides a sacrifice and forgive our sins? I feel like if I had the weight of the entire worlds sins on me, I, a random guy, would sacrifice myself for the greater good of society. Is this not just the RIGHT thing to do? We put so much emphasis on it, but is it not the moral default to give the opportunity for everyone to be saved from eternal damnation?

Is this just hard for me to grasp because I’m not in a position of power like God, and I don’t see the sacrifice it actually was to come down to “our level” and die a human death? 

I know I didn’t really articulate perfectly how I feel, but I think it gets the point across. Thanks. ",1,True,Advice,advice,1.0,False,Advice

As a Christian, I find this incredibly offensive.  Does anyone actually think Trump is ""humble and gentle,"" ""promot[es] peace and unity,"" or ""put[s] God's will above self-interest and partisan politics?""

I get it when Christians say ""I don't care for him as a person or a model of moral behavior, but I'm voting on the policies he endorses.""

Here are my reasons behind wanting more political posts:

1. The US National Election has global consequences - since the USA has taken up the mantle of Rome, the US Elections are important for everyone, and will impact everyone in the globe at some level.
2. The commonly held opinion is that Christians must vote Republican in the US elections; and for conservative, reactionary, or theocratic political parties outside of US elections. This commonly held opinion is completely wrong\*, and silencing political posts in this subreddit will only reinforce that commonly held misconception.
3. As a logical consequence of #2, the view that this subreddit should have no (or fewer) political posts about the US election is itself a strongly biased political stance that heavily favors the Republican party. It is *not* a politically neutral stance.
4. Encouraging political conversation in this subreddit may help mobilize and encourage Christians throughout the world to be more politically active, and work through secular institutions to impact the world positively for Christ.
5. Encouraging political conversation in this subreddit might also encourage discussions about different Christian's opinions on more non-American national politics, or even local politics. Since those have more significant impacts on the daily living of everyone, this would be extremely beneficial to everyone - but it isn't common to see today because it isn't immediately *relevant* to as many people.
6. Getting people comfortable with the idea that Christianity is diverse, and thus has a diverse set of political stances is only a good thing, even if it does burst the bubble of some people who believe Jesus votes Red (or Blue in the case of New Zealand)

So while the political posts might be annoying to people who want to bury their head in the sand, I think they are all valuable contributions to this subreddit, and for the people who use the subreddit, and I want to see more of them.

\* To clarify, the converse (""Christians must not vote for conservative, reactionary, or theocratic political parties"") is also completely wrong. Christians can vote for all ***types*** of political parties without betraying Jesus.",92,True,Meta,meta,0.56,False,Meta

June 10, 2015 by [Trisha Mugo](https://trishamugo.com/author/trishamugo/) 

https://preview.redd.it/6abuijfaj3yd1.jpg?width=684&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c901a57e9fc2fe0289d809a6b624aace2bba6d

Tom and Jerry cartoons always bored me. Why would anyone want to watch Tom chase Jerry for more than one episode?

Despite, Tom’s near catches, Jerry almost always outwits Tom. The same story told over and over again gets old.

Or does it? I never grasped Tom and Jerry’s power to hypnotize until my two-year old dragged me onto the sofa with him to watch. That day I understood why the cat-and-mouse franchise just celebrated its 75th birthday.

Right there on the sofa Tom and Jerry taught me three principles we as Christians need to embrace as we preach “Christ and him crucified,” (1 Cor. 1:23).

* **Children don’t watch the show to hear a new story. They watch see the old story told in a new and interesting way.**
* Tom and Jerry’s producers know how to reinvent the classic cartoon without losing its essence. Through updated music and modern animation, its creators keep the story relevant.

Churches must do the same. Creativity doesn’t change our message—it only enhances it. We need to tell the Christ story in a different way.

Books chock full of religious jargon, or “Christian-ese,” fill libraries. We need to find fresh words and replace stale analogies. When we talk to our friends about Christ, we need metaphors that relate to culture.

* **My kids watch to see the simple story unfold into new layers.**

They find comfort in knowing how the basic story doesn’t change.

And isn’t this true of the gospel? We could live for 500 years and never plumb its depths or appreciate its beauty.

The gospel’s never-ending work in us keeps peeling callouses from our hearts and challenging us to new levels of love and grace.

https://preview.redd.it/krup8htzj3yd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbb3d54246e8c4d374443061672743665bbc3a45

* **The story itself matters.**

No one tunes in to see if Tom will actually catch Jerry (although he does a few times). Creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera understood this.

Likewise, Christians need to stand on the conviction the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus matter. But for an example of an old story told afresh, we can look no further than the Cartoon Network.

That day on the sofa I saw Tom dance the flamenco across the screen, in step with a castanet-clad kitty.

My five-year old’s eyes widened, probably anticipating the banana Jerry flings onto the platform.

I don’t remember the rest of the episode. I was too busy watching my son’s belly jiggle in laughter while I savored their wild guffaws, their eyes transfixed on the TV.

18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:

“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;

the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”\[c\]

20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law?   
Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.

For example John the Baptist  being a forerunner and herald of the messiah is a really interesting and epic story, also the mystery around him makes for a really compelling and interesting lecture, but all I can find is people who interject ""chist is king!! gimme an AMEN!!"" every 30 seconds of their lecture.

I recently prayed to Jesus and acknowledged him as Lord and Saviour after spending a 10+ year hiatus as Agnostic/Atheist. I've returned to Church and I prayed and asked Jesus to reveal himself to me. 

All my life I have had intensly Vivid/Lucid dreams. About a week after my prayer, I had this dream: 

I was walking down the street in my country home town, except it had become more like a city with huge skyscrapers that loomed over the streets. I walked past a group of Hasidic Jewish men (my family has Jewish lineage) and they ignored me. 

I then found myself in the old hall where I used to go to a youth group as a child. The hall was empty, but then my grandfather (who died years ago of old age) appeared. Except he was a lot younger version of himself (approx. In his 40s). He didn't speak to me, but we immediately recognised each other. He was not a religious man during his lifetime, however he held up a cross necklace and prayed to Jesus. 

My Grandfather held my hand and it was like I could feel the warmth of his heart through my body and into my bones (sounds weird I know). 

The roof got ripped off the hall and then an intense white light came down from the sky and I felt warm. Jesus spoke to me telepathically and even though I couldn't see him, I just knew it was him. His voice was in my head. It was a soothing voice with a masculine, gravelly like undertone. He told me to trust in him, and that I would soon join him and my family in Heaven. 

When I woke up I felt that I had just been holding my Grandfather's hands. His hands were dry and worn as he worked as a farmer. My hands felt dry, like his. I felt cool air on my face and my body felt giddy, like how you feel when you get off a roller coaster. It was as if I had just been teleported back to Earth from another dimension.

My car is leaking, out of nowhere, then my lights wouldn't turn off when I was in my car, so I had to disconnect my battery bc the bulbs were so hot and wouldn't shut off. So with these issues at hand, here is my dream from last night after the clock hit 12am I could NOT rest!! 
So in my dream: a demon that is rotting away, appearance is like a black vest, black pants, chain on the belt loop, and he has straight shoulder length hair that's a middle part and very sleek, the only part of the demons that ever look good in my dreams is their hair. (Past few dreams, demons have had longer and straight black hair - reminding me of punk rock, or something) 
He is walking towards me, my back is against the wall, he is smirking at me, his skin is dark green, his eyes are sunken in, no white in them, just black holes but I feel something staring at me in those holes, I had a gun in this dream, shooting away at him, at his heart, he smiled bigger, and was saying something like ""you think that's gonna work?"" He pealed his vest back slightly, revealing the bullet wounds that were doing absolutely nothing to effect him, he placed his vest back over his 3 wounds, I began to run, he was like Micheal Myers, walked ... Fast... He was coming after me, I was in like a college or something, I ran into a library, and a human formed demon, with large black and red tinted sharp like dragon or bat wings, flies over me and swarms and picks him up, slinging him across the room towards the middle of these bookshelves, body slamming him, all I see is him being eaten, and the wings of the demon piercing in the shoulders of the original punk guy- holding him down, his wings so big it covered what he was doing. Glad to be rescued from that demon, I kept running, a girl I recognizes in a shirt I always wear, its just a yellow t shirt my mom got me on one of her trips, the girl was running behind me, them all the sudden I heard a gunshot and turned around again, she was saying on the ground, dead. I kept running, seeing almost hundreds of people running down these catwalks, I must've reached a dorm or something, I ran into the room and the dream ended. I woke up. ",10,True,,,0.4,False,

No “leader” has the right to make any calls in God’s church, we are to go to God for all decision! No calls are to be made on your own.

I came across a post the other day where people in the comments were promoting pastors being able to judge others.

No “leader” has a right to judge anyone. No one is holy but The Lord. Unholy people cannot judge other unholy people by a holy standard.

We are all sinners apart from The Lord, no one has the right to Judge other than God.

 Jesus Christ who is The Lord said do not judge, for the measure you use to judge others will be measured against you.

   A sinner who judges another is worse than a sinner, that one is a hypocrite. 

You cannot judge someone else while yourself being a sinner yourself.

 Crimes are breaking human laws, a human judge who judge someone for a crime he himself committed is a hypocrite.

  Sin is breaking God’s law, only God judges who breaks His Law. To your own maker you live or die.

And all the unbelievers are watching. I know all these people have good intentions, but that doesn’t necessarily mean what they are doing is helpful. Scripture is being used to defend one side or the other, when really certain verses could be applied in either direction. 

Why aren’t we all more focused on not giving power to any of this in our lives? Our peace, our joy, our loves comes the Lord. 

Wouldn’t we be much more effective in pointing people towards Christ if we followed what He has commanded of us? To love above all else?? 

Instead of “this is why you shouldn’t or should vote for xyz or do xyz” why not “the Lord is calling me to love and pray for both political candidates” “the Lord is calling me to love all those who celebrate Halloween, to not judge them, to remind them of His love”.

53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

12, 1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.

3Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

4And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

9But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

10And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

11And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

12For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.

***Commentary*****:**

“***And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things: Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.***” (vs. 53-54) Our study for today, begins with Luke telling us how the Pharisees and other religious leaders had begun to verbally assail Jesus, desperately trying to trip him up, so as to discredit him in the eyes of the people. Just prior to these passages, Jesus had condemned his antagonists for many things, but in verse 52 he had told them that their worst crime was that of the legalisms they had created that in essence kept the people away from God.

“*One can almost feel the withering force of His strong and mighty indignation – indignation directed, not against the people, but against their false guides. And yet behind it all is His heart, and the ‘woes’ merge into a wail of agony, the cry of a mother over her lost child.*” (Morgan)

“...***the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently,***”Other translations use the word assail, in place of urge, as see here in the KJV. “*They did not receive Jesus’ correction. They preferred to stay in their own sinful thinking and habits rather than to repent and learn from Jesus’ rebuke. Their reaction was strong and violent in words if not action.*” (Guzik)

“...***and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.***” The religious leaders responded the way many do when they are faced with the correction and the truth of God. Instead of humbly receiving the correction, they responded with outraged accusations.

Moving on into chapter 12 we find: “***In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another,***” (v. 1) As Jesus continued in the general direction towards Jerusalem, vast multitudes came to hear Him. The crowds were so large that some were injured as they trampled (***trode one upon another***) each other.Speaking more to his disciples than to the multitude, he warned them of the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, comparing their hypocrisy to leaven: “***Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy***.”

“*Hypocrisy is like leaven in the sense that it only takes a little bit of it to affect a great mass. A little bit of hypocrisy can be like a little bit of arsenic. In light of their tremendous popularity, it was especially important for the disciples to remember this. The temptation to hypocrisy is often strongest to those who enjoy some measure of outward success.*”(Guzik)

“*Such is hypocrisy, which also, as leaven, is: 1. spreading; 2. swelling; 3. souring the meal*.” (Trapp)

“***For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.***”(v. 2)

“*The art of being a hypocrite depends on concealment, but one day all will be revealed. We can only be hypocrites before men, but never before God. He sees through the actor’s mask.*” (Guzik)

“***And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.***” (vs. 4-5) Although the text reads; “***I say unto you my friends***” we do not know if he was speaking exclusively to his disciples or if he was addressing the multitude. “*Given the context, it is probably best to think that Jesus spoke to His disciples, but in the plain hearing of the crowd.*” (Guzik) When Jesus spoke to these disciples of His about martyrdom and persecution, He knew that all of them – except John – would die martyr’s deaths for Him. He also knew of His own coming suffering.Therefore he is offering words of comfort, reminding them that there is for more worse things than the death of our mortal body, such as the death of the soul itself.

“***Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him***”

“*All persecutors can do is kill, and God has ultimate power over the life and death of the believer. Therefore, we shouldn’t fear our persecutors, but have a healthy respect of God that makes us more concerned with obeying Him than any man.*”(Guzik)

“*A man has but one life to lose, and one soul to save; and it is madness to sacrifice the salvation of the soul to the preservation of the life.*” (Clarke)

The word translated hell is Gehenna. It is derived from the words Valley of Hinnom, which was located on the south and west sides of Jerusalem. In the Old Testament it was a place of child-sacrifice to Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3, Jeremiah 7:30-31, 19:1-6, 32:35). The reforming King Josiah stopped child sacrifice in the Valley of Hinnom (2 Kings 23:10) and it became a garbage dump, a stench with continually smoldering fires. In the days of Jesus it became associated with eternal, fiery punishment – what is called the lake of fire in other passages (Revelation 19:20, 20:10-15).

“*Now of two evils the less is to be chosen, and the greater is to be dreaded, and therefore I say unto you, Fear him."" ""It is true,"" said that blessed martyr, Bishop Hooper, ""life is sweet, and death bitter; but eternal life is more sweet, and eternal death more bitter.’*” (Henry)

“***Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.***” (vs. 6-7) If God remembers the sparrows, He will not forget you – so don’t lose heart. There are few things worse than the sense of being forgotten; Jesus assured every believer that their life was precious and remembered before God.

“ *It has been said that a redhead has about 90,000 hairs; a dark-haired person has about 120,000 hairs, and a blonde has about 145,000. Yet God knows exactly how many hairs you have; if He knows that about you, He also knows all the important things.*” (Guzik)

“*To encourage us in times of difficulty and danger, we must have recourse to our first principles, and build upon them. Now a firm belief of the doctrine of God's universal providence, and the extent of it, will be satisfying to us when at any time we are in peril, and will encourage us to trust God in the way of duty. \[1.\] Providence takes cognizance of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows. ""Though they are of such small account that five of them are sold for two farthings, yet not one of them is forgotten of God, but is provided for, and notice is taken of its death. Now, you are of more value than many sparrows, and therefore you may be sure you are not forgotten, though imprisoned, though banished, though forgotten by your friends; much more precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of saints than the death of sparrows."" \[2.\] Providence takes cognizance of the meanest interest of the disciples of Christ: ""Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered (v. 7); much more are your sighs and tears numbered, and the drops of your blood, which you shed for Christ's name's sake. An account is kept of all your losses, that they may be, and without doubt they shall be, recompensed unspeakably to your advantage.*” (Henry)

“***Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.***” (vs. 8-9) “*To engage us to confess Christ before men, whatever we may lose or suffer for our constancy to him, and how dear soever it may cost us, we are assured that they who confess Christ now shall be owned by him in the great day before the angels of God, to their everlasting comfort and honour. Jesus Christ will confess, not only that he suffered for them, and that they are to have the benefit of his sufferings, but that they suffered for him, and that his kingdom and interest on earth were advanced by their sufferings; and what greater honour can be done them?*” (Henry)

“*Jesus did not say, denies Me in their heart or denies me in their mind; He said, denies Me before men. There is a real and important place for a public declaration of allegiance to Jesus. For many, this is the most difficult thing of all – and is usually difficult because of a fear of man, the exact thing Jesus warned against in His previous words (Luke 12:4-7).*” (Guzik)

“***And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.***” (v. 10) “*This probably refers to a moment of weakness (especially in public testimony), which could be forgiven. In contrast, he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit is in a settled rejection of God’s truth, which will not be forgiven.*” (Guzik)

“***And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.***” (vs. 11-12) “*Jesus also warned them that men would persecute them in civic arena (magistrates) and religious arena (synagogues). They could expect opposition from both city hall and the halls of religion. Jesus spoke these words to men who would face this exact challenge. Thousands upon thousands since them have faced this challenge and received God’s sustaining grace in it.*” (Guzik)

“...***take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:***” Take ye no thought, or in other words, do not worry about what you will say in your defense, the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say. “*It was not the humiliation which early Christians dreaded, not even the cruel pain and the agony. But many of them feared that their own unskilfulness in words and defence might injure rather than commend the truth. It is the promise of God that when a man is on trial for his faith, the words will come to him.*” (Barclay)

This isn’t a justification of poor preparation in teaching and preaching God’s Word, but it is a promise of strength and guidance for the persecuted that have an opportunity to testify of Jesus.

1ggmsqa,"Take care, the devil's got a Trump ready against us, and he's not even hiding it in his sleeve!",Meditat0rz,2024-10-31 19:26:52+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ggmsqa/take_care_the_devils_got_a_trump_ready_against_us/,0,/r/Christianity/comments/1ggmsqa/take_care_the_devils_got_a_trump_ready_against_us/,Christianity,"America is to the ballots again. I'm from Europe, and it's interesting for me how elections in the USA are like a fight between only 2 players, that's always close. I don't think it reflects a proper democracy...but anyways it is the choice of the people, and it is always an important choice where the country would be lead to.

Now once again I have fears and sorrow, because of the candidate that is Trump. Also I currently am in a situation of sprouting and rooting and growing faith. And as a new born Christian I am shocked with how Trump both makes no secret of his more than morally questionable behavior in his private and public life, with the way how he wants to propagate his policies, with the moral values he represents to the public by his behavior. And I am especially shocked by how he shamelessly uses the name of Christ to promote his own values and agendas, even riding on waves of what seems like propaganda that is outright blasphemous and anti-Christian in my view.

I hope you know the kind of propaganda I am thinking of, it is just shameful to idolize a politician as a Christian this way by associating the most anti-Christian values like pride, deception, racism, free use of weapons, environmental destruction, social hardship and exclusion of foreigners, socially divisive policies, discrimination of women, shameless homophobia and disregard of disabled or weak people. All this in the name of Christ and glorifying him as he was the glorified person himself. Being glorified by somebody else crucified, who thought moral values that were in part completely against those which this man is openly publicly demonstrating to promote his policies.

So while Trump may claim that he has nothing to do with all these weird pictures and texts floating around the internet, he cannot deny that he is neither speaking up about or against it, nor doing anything else to deal with it. For me, that he ignores it and doesn't openly speak up or distance himself from it, means he condones it. He condones conspiracy theories and outright deceptive propaganda used for his cause, he condones lies and deceptions being told to his followers for his favor. He gladly ignores the deception of people, and even plays with the cliches of outright propaganda blaspheming him as a Christ or using made up conspiracies that range from bringing vulnerable people into the ward or jails to making a lot of them try enter the capitol with violence. I say you can't deny that this man knows the world is right now systematically being fed with shameless lies about him and his opponents, while everyone is watching and trying to seem as if nothing happened. He is using this propaganda for his cause, he is supporting the American people and the whole world being lied to for him to gain unrighteous access to the power of the USA.

I can only say, that I am more than puzzled why the worldwide deception with propaganda and lies to the favor or right, far right or right/conservative populist parties and leaders is being taken for granted by everyone with nobody speaking of it. Maybe it just takes another Greta Thunberg, to speak up like a child against the blinded who dabble with mental poisons thinking they are gold, poisoning themselves and the whole world with them.

I mean, looking at the other side, I also don't see the values I'd expect from Christ full on represented, this is true. However, the other side which is the democrats, are to my understanding the much more respectable choice to lead the USA than this man and the people under and behind him. The democrats don't declare themselves to be Christian, but they respect the separation of religion and state. Even Christ preached this, he would be the king of the kingdom of God, not of the world, he preached to let to the world what is worldly, and to keep with Christ what is of God.

So looking at what these people do with the world, I see the democrats have through and through the more social choices than the republicans right now represent. This is where I would want a government to comply with Christ. Not representing him, like the pope would, or every priest or pastor or lay preacher and every believer with Christ in their hearts. Representing Christ as in their hearts, but serving the people as being of the people and for the people. This is how to fulfill Christ as a government, treating everyone equally fair and respecting the rights of all groups of the population to maintain peace. Being responsible, also being made responsible by the people whom they are to serve. Just these people are humble and keep it quiet, trying to argue responsibly instead of making a great show like a deceiver and blinder would try. Maybe that's why they are not so present in the minds of many, because they are too quiet against those blinding them with being loud and nasty and shamefully unrighteous about their cause. This will work, unless people manage to discern what is righteous and what is not. People seem not to be able - so they listen to the one shouting the loudest and making the weirdest faces?

Trump instead rides on waves of showing him as if he was the Son of God himself, as if he was the holy emperor of the USA. This is not good, this is dangerous. Trump is not God, he is a sinner, like we all are. Even he is a great, shameless sinner, using all unclean and unfair tricks in rhetoric and manipulation, even outright lying without allowing others to make him responsible for it. People, listen, if you give such a man too much power...then his ego will inflate and he would really think there is nobody above him. Remember, Christ serves everyone, he is the least humbling himself below the feet of everyone to help them, while not allowing them to exploit him to become the greatest of all. This man serves his ego, and rhetoric dividing people into winners and losers, by force and deception, and not by righteousness.

This is dangerous, because righteousness knows no losers, but Trump divides people into such categories while claiming to be holy even. The holy ego...now imagine what ego is, it is selfish pride, it is greed, it is hatred, it is the wish to dominate others. All this is destructive, all these are egoistic motives and intentions that hurt people and destroy things to be fulfilled. This is what Trump preaches, ""America first"". But he is quiet about what this means for everything and everyone, who is not American enough for this dangerous man. If he would even speak up truthfully about his sincere motivations and plans, probably people would soon argue that his ways are not up to his promises. Still people only buy the show, and the show is an illusion. Then the whole country is led by an illusionist, and will not be able to stand up to reality.

So as a Christian, I urge you to consider not to give your trust to this man, even when he claims to be the better choice for Christians. People like him, claim that Harris is pro-choice, but won't make a full statement about being pro-life because it would threaten their success - he couldn't afford losing his non-Christian voters after all. Harris instead makes no secret of her position. Now this might be a gruesome thing for you to hear from a Christian - but please consider, even if you think that life is holy and abortion is murder, that this women thinks from the other side and considers what the situation means for the women who wish to abort, also because of the circumstances they are living in. For a pro-choice activist this is an ethical question, that a woman must be responsible for her body and the fruit while she depends on it, and that this can include preventing or aborting pregnancy and preventing the even greater responsibility of parenthood, which many of these women would break from due to lack of people taking care of their children as they think the children would deserve. Women like her, know what it means for other women to live where abortion is illegal, it can be a great horror for all who are involved. This is still then a seed of life that was wasted, and it is most hurtful and a pitch-black dark thought, but I also believe it is not right to put many women into these different hells to live through already in our world, just to make some others scared enough so they would take more care.

So while Harris cares for these women, Trump also cares for the opinions of his voters, as long as they are a majority among them. He cares about their lives and allows them to keep guns to kill others. This is his law, not of mercy and justice. But he wants to allow people to be able to shoot others dead who break a rule. Now if anyone could have a gun, anyone could shoot any offender. And anyone would make anything wrong to gain an opportunity to shoot somebody they'd hate. Now you have Harris, proponent of killing a fetus where people think it is misfit. And there you have Trump, who wants to allow his people to kill some of the disadvantaged later on in life, selecting the fortunate and the unfortunate among them, the unfortunate being subject to the violence he would allow the police or even simple citizens to enact, the power over life and death.

I've even seen these AI propaganda pictures of him like Jesus holding guns! As if killing another man out of anger or pride is a holy thing, instead of letting a copper do the job who knows how to lock up somebody without killing or crippling them. So I want to recite the Prophet Micah, a very good book to read for anyone who wants to know what happens, if Kings do wrongs and use deceptions, or what happens to traders who deceive others and work only for their profit. So this is about weapons and war, where is God when it comes to weapons and war in his holy land:

Micah 4:2-5

>2 \[...\] He will teach us about his ways,

>and we will walk according to his directions.’

>“Indeed, the Law will proceed from Zion,

>and the message of the Lord from Jerusalem.

>3 And he will judge among many people,

>rebuking strong nations far away;

>**and they will reshape their swords as plowshares**

>**and their spears as pruning hooks.**

>**No nation will threaten another,**

>**nor will they train for war anymore.**

>4 Instead, each man will sit in the shade of his grape vines

>and beneath the shade of his fig tree,”

>since the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has spoken.

So while I am writing this, I am living on disability because my mind was crippled by life, I am constantly oppressed inside my soul, as if by invisible beings speaking and projecting thoughts and manipulating my mind to cause me fear, pains and mental oppression, trying to make me succumb to fear and evil - I know the Lord gives me the strength to resist, still the hallucinations render me unable to work. With a sad tear I think of America where somebody like would couldn't live in dignity and work for the Lord, but I would probably already be homeless, locked up in a ward or dead due to the lack of social policies. Now Harris - is still an American spirit, and probably wouldn't change too much about it. Still I know she was busy with disability rights and social rights and trying to make the situation for people like in America more tolerable and fair. 

But Trump, only made public statements, recommending even a relative of suicide and accusing his opponents and even Harris of mental problems, even mental illness to discredit them to the public. So how should I, as a disabled person, trust in a man who scorns disabled people so much he would even recommend a relative suicide, and use it as an insult of his opponents? This is the lowest register to use, still this man uses even much lower ones and it doesn't just make me sad, it makes me terrified of the future that would happen if people like this could make it and establish this systematic discrimination of the weak as a new, cruel, heartless - and completely anti-christian ethical and moral code and standard of open communications. I wouldn't want this to happen, so I wouldn't recommend anyone to vote for Trump.

What does our God instead say of disabilities? Look here again in Micah 4:

>6 “At that time,” declares the Lord,

>“I will assemble the lame;

>and I will gather those whom I have scattered,

>along with those whom I have afflicted.

>7 **I will transform the lame into survivors**,

>and those who were scattered into a strong nation;

>and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion,

>now and forever.”

This is when you know that for your God, you're not a burden or a loser, but the most precious gem of soul and worthy of his love, like anyone else under his creation, and even more for the hardship you'd be able to endure that others wouldn't be able to accept even.

So then, this is my rant for now on the coming elections. I am not a prophet to tell who would win, and how America would be reigned the next 4 years. But I know enough of God to have fears that the Americans could make a wrong choice and get ruled by the king of sin instead of reasonable politicians.

And look how far the American morals have come so far. When Bill Clinton made an error with Monica Lewinsky, it was a big shame for the whole world and a big discussion, Bill almost had to quit his job and was discredited for the rest of his life. Now Trump seems to think that's it and Bill was already judged for him. This man openly professes the most misogynistic statements, openly calls out statements of sexual abuse and complete disrespect of other people's intimacy. This man even has been on court for various accusations of abusing his role and status for transgressing against women in various ways. This is not the moral of Christ, this man does not just lust in the mind he grabs what he desires, and doesn't even try to hide or make himself responsible for it. This man wants to normalize sin, instead of representing the abstinence from it worthily. This man cannot be serious about his stance towards Christ - if he thinks that Christ allows sin, then he should again think about how little sin a king would be allowed, when it's already hard for a peasant to bear.

Trump even claims that God has preserved him, showing his mark on the right ear. Yes, somebody tried to kill him for his ways, and he survived by a chance that is like miraculous. But I today had another frightening thought - what if God did not preserve him to prevail, but just so that he wouldn't be slain in injustice, but by his own sins? Because God is God, he will not slay anyone with brute force or injustice. He will make people fail by their own errors, by their own sins and mistakes. But it is the responsibility of the people to uncover them and make the rulers responsible, else the errors must first become very big before God could step down on them. We will see.

So this is my concern, and thanks for reading. Please, make the right choice now and do not sell out your country for the devil. I believe we live in modern times, and the devil will sell himself as a saint and his opponents as demons. Look at how the people act, how they treat others, how they live privately, how honest and humble they are. A servant of a country is to be honest and humble, else his sins would drown the whole nation, because they would spread on the citizens and normalize all evils done by the head. Please make the right choice, please chose a humble leader!

Thank you for your attention, and God bless you, whose righteousness and mercy is beyond that of any living man or women, and who is ready to give it to each of us if we were just willing to let go of what makes us hurt each other down to our heart. This is God, and not somebody's ego or success. God is in the love that saves and preserves life instead. Please chose preserving our all lives, and the whole world, for righteousness and not for the glory of sin which leads to eternal destruction.",13,True,Politics,politics,0.31,False,Politics

Scripture: Hebrews 1:3  “He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and *he upholds the universe* by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”

Just like the earth relies on the sun to keep it alive we too rely on the Son of God to keep us alive and functional. The truth of the matter is that there is so much power and auhtority in Christ, everything in us and around us relies on Him. 


Have you ever noticed that it's only when the door is removed that you begin to see its value? When you lose something valuable, its value increases because you no longer have it.

In the same way lot of people just go about their day to day lives without paying attention to Jesus and His role in their lives. It is when He moves away. 


When He leaves that you realise there was someone there shielding you from all harm who has moved. We need to understand that the authority of Jesus Christ is always there. 


We just choose to ignore Him and focus on othe things. You do not pay attention to your heart when it is healthy but when it starts misbehaving you are concerned about is and you pay attention. 


I urge you all to recognise your need for Christ before you are in a tough place. Just like some people start eating well and exercising before they get sick. You too are supposed to look for Christ when all is still well with you.

She also never really got a chance to say goodbye to her dad, the holidays are coming up soon which must sting, her dad had long been suffering from medical issues before the accident—just a lot of things compounded at once.

I was talking about this situation with another mutual friend of ours. I said our friend’s feelings are valid and it’s ok for her to be angry.

He also said that losing parents is just part of life, and it takes time for wounds to heal, but I think for some people some wounds may never heal.

Mattana Ministry 

Welcomes You To : 

Daily Bible Study: 31 October 2024

Theme: Book of Jeremiah (2)

Scripture: Jeremiah 4; Jeremiah 5; Jeremiah 6 & Jeremiah 5:25

Message:

LIVING AS CHILDREN OF GOD 

God expects us not to live in sin; He wants us to live in holiness. Sometimes in life we may have deviated from His way or made mistakes that hurt God, but He always forgives us for every mistake we make and accepts us as His beloved children.

In Jeremiah 6, God reminded the Israelites, who had deviated from the path of righteousness to idolatry and ungodliness, to return to Him. Unfortunately this nation did not accept the Word of God that was conveyed by Jeremiah and because of their rebellion and disobedience, Jerusalem and her inhabitants who did not repent, experienced great destruction.

It is our sins and our faults that separate us from God. ""Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, That it cannot save; Nor His ear heavy, That it cannot hear. But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, So that He will not hear."" Isaiah 59:1-2 NKJV

Pay attention! Sin separates man from God, but sanctification draws people closer to Him because He, Whom we worship, is the Most Holy God. Therefore, if we want to face the Lord, our life must also be holy. God wants us to have a righteous life before Him, to live in repentance and away from sin.

We should keep away from sin because it separates us from God.

I feel that these people have never opened a Bible before because if they did, they would realize that Jesus is nothing like Trump.

Trump has broken several of the **Ten Commandments**:

* **He committed adultery** by fornicating with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, while being married to Melania. During the hush money trial, it also came to light that he had an affair with Karen McDougal while married to Melania.
* **He has beared false witness against his neighbor** by continuously lying about everyone and everything. Recently, he spread misinformation against FEMA during the Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. He has also stated that Haitian immigrants are eating people’s cats and dogs.
* He is a fraudster which I feel violates the “**thou shall not steal**” commandment. A jury found him guilty on 34 fraud-related felony counts. Would you trust a felon around your children?

Also the Bible says to **“love thy neighbor”** which Trump is the antithesis of. Here are some examples:

* He has stated that he wants to prosecute his critics and opponents by using televised military tribunals.
* He has called those who oppose him the “enemy within” and has floated the idea of using the military against them.
* He wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants which will break up families.

1gg8trm,I met a strange man in jail who claimed to be Melchizedek.

This was on the week of the Hamas terror attacks.

I had another mental health-related episode.

I had been attacked in a unprovoked bad jail fight, where I was moved and taken to medical, then moved into another less hostile cell block.

I had met a man named “Tony Martin”. He was 7'3"", and I thought he was a real-life giant. He looked old, and withered. He said he lived in my state, but it was over by a church with three crosses.

He was a strange old fellow and reminded me of a charlatan. Or even the Count of Saint Germaine.

He was just “there”, and shourded in his all white bed sheet cloak over his head. He did this because he was the most paranoid about the cameras, and would mumble subtle under his breath lightly every sentence. Enough where you could only see/hear it if you leaned in. The whole time. I didn’t notice him when I was let into the new cell block of 30 people. He might of been sleeping blocked behind bed dividers, but that's something I never saw coming back to the idea of where he was when I slept. When they re-moved me there and didn’t have a bunk for me. I slept on the concrete floor with my bed. I took it up and walked under a shelf.

He taught me alchemy by eating cooked broccoli and fish oils to cure cancer etc., showing me recipes to make and create solid gold plus jewels from glue, asphalt, wax adhesives, and numerous ideas. He had it all written down for me. Before they confiscated all my paperwork before leaving jail.

He was running around like a wizard, saying, ""Go back into the back of the bathroom, make sure you're alone, and check the inside of your sock, there is a ""$1,000,000,000 piece of gold""

Then, he would run back to the bathroom, pull out an imaginary piece of gold, and stick it in his pocket like a token to move him forward in his game of advancing next in jail, feeling happily successful with an achievement. Unhappy if you didn't follow in full spirit.

He said his brother was DEA, and I needed to move to South Africa because they were trying to charge me. I still don't know how much of that is the truth; I get hash sent from California in an illegal state. Not anymore.

He told me that he had never died and was forever old and ageless. This was a new idea for me. While my bail was being processed, I had the chance to read all of the Psalms passages from the Bible with him. After he saw me, he exclaimed ""You're an angel!""

He was talking about the biblical prophecy of when Jesus returns, with just having two suns, and two moons in the sky. I looked into this theory, afterward never hearing of this biblical prophecy from Psalms. (Is there? Fill me in) My name is Jonah.

My name is biblical in connotation. He taught me all about ""I shall not want"", ""The tongue is harder to tame than a lion"", ""Be kosher and meek"", ""Don't make mountains out of molehills""

He said his name was Melchizedek. When looking at the Biblical figure in the stories of the Bible, online afterward at home. It says that he never died and is still alive to this date.

""A second biblical figure that is said to never have died is Melchizedek, the ethereal priest-king of Salem. In Genesis 14:18, Melchizedek apparently materializes while Abram is speaking to the King of Sodom, blesses Abram, and then following the exchange of a tithe, apparently disappears, while Abram continues his conversation with the King of Sodom in verse 21. This ephemeral encounter caused the author of Hebrews 7:3 to write concerning Melchizedek, ""Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life..."" contributing to the legend that Melchizedek never died.""

He said that he was trapped in jail and that he couldn't get out for some time. An interesting theory. He said he had been in the system awaiting trial for numerous years, and I was his saving grace. They kept stalling his court date and moving him around. Trapped by a corrupted system and an evil money-hungry warden. Looking around at the Hell on Earth, that facility was. I could honestly believe an institutionalized story like that. He wrote down every bit of personal information he had: bank account information, logins, and passwords. He needed me to get him a lawyer. He got me my saving grace phone call to my contact outside who paid my bail, and he saved my life because I ran out of money for calls when my bond was lowered and posted.

I got out before I saw him ever again.",0,True,Self,self,0.5,False,Self

1gg8p7j,Job – Who is He?,nonmatrixhuman,2024-10-31 07:09:52+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gg8p7j/job_who_is_he/,1,/r/Christianity/comments/1gg8p7j/job_who_is_he/,Christianity,"This is the second introductory post about the Book of Job. While the first post discussed what we are dealing with, this one will focus on whom we are dealing with.

The Book of Job provides extensive details about him. We know his biography and description as well as we know those of David or Moses.

At first glance, the character of Job evokes positive emotions, even admiration. The reader wonders why Job suffers, empathizing with him and ultimately sharing his joy. Job and his story raise significant religious questions.

However, a deeper study of Job, backed by a substantial theological background, begins to paint a frightening picture. The scale and spiritual potential of Job is intimidating, as is his audacity.

The Greek text consistently softens the sharpness of the narrative and Job's daring actions. The Hebrew text tends to diminish Job's character. The Talmudic tradition even suggests a blasphemous idea: the Book of Job is merely a parable, and Job himself never existed.

Let's dive deeper into this matter.

According to the Hebrew text, Job seems to possess all the attributes associated with the greatest figures of the Tanakh—he is a servant, righteous, blameless, just, God-fearing, and pure, much like Abraham or Noah.

However, the Greek text introduces a problem with a single word. In addition to all these characteristics, it first mentions that Job is true (ἀληθινός). The issue here is that in the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments, truth belongs only to God; truth is God. Consequently, the term ""true"" is exclusively used to describe God. Yet, here it is used to describe a man. Moreover, God Himself calls Job true.

If truth is God: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life,"" then who is the true man Job? Divine? Closest to God? The most godlike among men? Closest to the ideal or to a complete human? Is Job superhuman? And this is considering that Job himself acknowledges the original sin acting upon him.

Here, a thoughtful reader faces a challenge. It's understandable why some Jews diminished Job's status or even regarded him as a fictional character. But Jewish theologians of the 3rd century BC, translators of the book into Greek, nonetheless translated it as ""true"" and did not dare to remove or replace this term with a more ""decent"" synonym.

And not just from the perspective of Judaism. From the standpoint of Christianity, the story of Job is puzzling. After the Resurrection of Christ, we all became the body of God, with God living in our hearts, and we all became deified, potential supermen. This is clear. But Job, an ancient Near Eastern king did not even know the Torah. Who is he, what is he, and what is God's plan for Job?

Yet the book, even the diminished image in the Hebrew text, not to mention the Greek, portrays a truly true man in whom all positive characteristics and gifts from God converged and merged. Indeed, Job's uniqueness and his religious experience—comparable to the experiences of Moses and the prophets—are not just about terms like ""true"" but about his entire story.

Job encompasses all of this. He represents the utmost a person could be before the incarnation of Christ.

It is due to such qualities that God endowed Job with both material blessings and spiritual gifts. But even when everything was taken from Job, he still did not lose his divine quality and did not turn away from God.

God describes Job as: 

*""There is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil""* (Job 1:8).

And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?(KJV Job 1:8).

And since Job has such a high status and spiritual potential—greater than all Jewish righteous men and prophets—he is also more profoundly aware of God's Providence. And what is the most important in Yahweh's Providence? Precisely, Christ the Savior. And what does it mean to know—it is to connect with the known.

Therefore, Job cannot but be tempted, and cannot but suffer in the context of Salvation. Since Job is, conditionally, the second man after Christ on earth, he must follow Christ's path. As it is known, Christ's path involves innocent suffering and temptations by the Devil. On the other hand, this path also includes victory.

The Book of Job is about how the true Man Job followed the path of the true God-man Christ as much as it is fundamentally possible for a man as such. By walking this path with God's help, Job reveals to himself and to us the mystery of Salvation.",2,True,,,1.0,False,

But my wife was really additament for me to watch this video in particular: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkSKMuyJk4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkSKMuyJk4Q)

  
In this video she shares her experiences about Yoga, and how just doing Yoga is worshiping the devil. And she was doing a lot of medication which she claims that she physically ""levitated off the floor about a foot"" (32:05 in the video) which really made me question the legitimacy of her story. 

Is she for real? Any fans of her here?

  
I just keep seeing my wife watch these female youtubers who all claim they were Ex-Witches and every single video of them is just trying to scare you that we are in a constant battle with the Devil... I dont know how youtube is filled with these “everything is demonic” flavor of Christianity. Like I feel like my faith is strong enough that I don't need to see Yoga as a threat. 

  
Do you guys have any recommendations on this topic and who to watch? And whats your opinion on Naela Rose? Is she legit? if so let me know, I want to keep a open mind about her for the sake of my wife.

Thanks!

“Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.”

It’s got to be my least favorite verse in the entirety of the Bible and here’s why:
In my experience, loving my enemies just gave them an excuse to treat me even worse than they already did.

Matthew 5:38-40

“But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also. If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too.”

To me, that’s like accepting abuse and mistreatment from horrible people. It’s like we can’t fight back. Don’t we have any right to fight back against bullies, abusers, and other horrible people?
I don’t understand why I should have to be the bigger person when someone is mean to me. That’s just letting them get away with their abusive behavior. Can’t I make a snarky comeback once in a while?

That’s just an invitation for your abusers to walk all over you. I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about people who were kind to their enemies and they always ended horribly.

Forgiveness sounds nice and all, but it’s so hard when the person who ruined your life gets to move on and be happy while you are left with nothing but the mental health issues and pain that they left you. And don’t get me wrong, I’m all for being nice and kind to people (who rightfully deserve it). But there comes a point when you have to fight back, even if it means treating them the same way they treat you.

Those were my thoughts on why I have a problem with these Bible verses.

I mean, He is all powerful, all knowing, all knowledgeable, why couldn't He remove R*pe, m*rder, t*rture, etc. From our minds?

I believe the church MUST conduct a discipline.   
However, including my wife, people say in two ways, ""You MUST forgive."" or ""You MUST wait until the Lord does the vengeance."" 

Below the line, you can read my story (Summarized) 

\--------------------------------

I am a non-citizen man living in the States and the father of two.  
And I am standing at a dead-end.

Last year, I got a job at a WELL-KNOWN campus ministry organization. This year, the organization petitioned the USCIS so that I could get an R-1 (a non-immigrant worker's status for the religious field).  
As soon as I became a full-time staff, the organization suddenly fired me without any specific reason.  
It happened two days before my fundraiser evening.  
I spoke with HR so that they could do a fair investigation and hearing. However, they said, ""Since you are an at-will employee, we WILL NOT do this.""

My ex-boss accused me based on the rumors he heard from my home church and never tried to prove them. (Also, my ex-female coworker lied and fabricated stories to accuse me.) When the elders began the investigation, this man said he did not believe any rumors about me. He just said he terminated me because he simply dislikes working with me.

I have a wife and two kids. Due to visa regulations, getting a job right now is too hard for me.  
The financial burden presses my shoulders a lot. If I cannot get a job, there are only two options: becoming an international student again or returning to my home country.

And the people involved in this story still come to the church and worship.  
Ironically, the pastors who know the injustice done to me remain silent now.  
The senior pastor at my church always emphasized, ""Gossiping is the brutal sin that is devastating the brothers and sisters."" However, he did nothing to those who gossiped and created rumors about me.

My wife always says, ""Honey, trust the Lord Jesus. He will repay the evil. Do not pay back any evil. Justice will be served because the Lord will do that. Your ex-boss knows many rich people at the church. His wife works in the mission department. This couple could make you a weirdo. They could make any false accusation against you.""  
However, I think justice must be served.

I cannot tolerate the injustice I have experienced.

I was with 4 other people and we all saw a shadow fly over the clouds and stop above the shed. Then my friend Zion walked under it and froze. I walked over to Zion, and he reached out towards me, blindly, not taking his eyes off the shadow, and pulled me next to him. I saw what he was looking at, but it was a little distorted at first and I couldn't tell what it was until I stepped a few steps to his left. Thats when I saw what he was looking at, an eye, and I froze for a second. Then I dropped to my knees, breaking my gaze, and asking Jesus Christ to protect me. After about a minute of asking for protection, I looked up again, and saw a look of understanding, something so peaceful and loving, and it scared me but I was sure it was good. If I remember correctly, I saw no eyelids, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, it was just a translucent outline of the sclera, Iris, and pupil, and the outline of the eye itself, where there would normally be eyelids. It was almost like the eye emoji (👁) except the Iris was partially covered by the top of the eye, like it was looking down on us. 
Zion broke his stare and asked if I saw it too, and I turned to him with an expression like, duh, of course I did. We both saw an eye. After this we talked about what we should do, what it could mean, all the while seeing this eye above us. Then we felt compelled to go for a walk, so we did. This eye stayed in the sky above us, in front of where we were walking, never blinking. Eventually the clouds covered it, and we lost it behind some trees, so we walked off the road to look around the other side. We then started following what we thought were arrows pointing us where to go. It was the tips of trees all pointing in one direction above the water, and the reflections looked like arrows. Then we got to this rock, and while I was standing there, I asked Zion where we should go from there. He was silent, so I said his name and he blindly grabbed me shoulder and pointed up. That's when I turned around, and I was in awe again, because this time, there were two eyes. They were beautiful, the sunlight was shining directly through them. This time they weren't looking down. We saw the whole iris, and we knew we had to go back to the road. We kept walking until we both felt like we should stop. We were on a hill now, staring up, looking for the eyes. Instead, the sky went dark, clouds blew in and filled the sky. We saw images in the clouds. The first was of a shadowed figure running from what most would call a cherub (I know biblical cherubim are different from the commonly accepted cherub). It was a baby angel, kneeling, with its hands over it's face, either praying or crying. The second image we saw was of four faces, the details of the faces I can't remember, all I was certain of was it was four faces. Then we saw the face of a white horse. Then I saw an elephants face, and he simultaneously saw a turtle. Then we saw Noah's Ark, in full detail, coming out from behind a cloud. Zion said he had a bad feeling and thought we should turn back. Now, for some reason, I wish I kept going. I want to see those eyes again. On the way back, the wind picked up, and the sky got darker. Half way back, Zion said he heard a voice. He said it told him that Jay and Sky were not home. A minute late Jay and Sky came walking out of the woods. (This was the first sign that it was real).

Then on the way back, Sky looked behind us and said he saw it too, and seemed shocked. We turned around a froze again, because we saw the eye, but this time it looked angry, like a disappointed glare. We turned around, frightened and kept walking. The next morning, Sky admitted he didn't really see the eye. (The second sign that this was real) 
Finally, at AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), the place where I had been developing my relationship with God and the place I was closest to God, I saw the elephants face. (The third sign that this was real, and the beginning of my current understanding)

For the first few weeks, before I saw the elephant, I thought it was signs of the end times. The shadow figures fighting with the angels, the four Horsemen, and the horse of death, and the ark made me believe so. 
Then I believed what I saw was a sign that I needed to come to God, the shadow was me, running from heaven, the four faces were those of God or a cherubim, the white horse was Jesus's white horse.

Now, in my current understanding, I think it was both. I need to come Christ for the end is near.
If anyone has any other ideas, any biblical context that could help me understand, or any interpretation of what else it could mean, please let me know. I still battle with my thoughts of what it could mean. Thank you and God bless.

All I could find that related to this was different angels, none of which fit the description of two translucent eyes, then I read this.

This year my dad (55 M) got extremely sick and lost 50lbs (180lbs in January 2024 to 131lbs September 2024) and looks like he aged 20 years within one year. I was really shocked this happened so fast. His health before was never this bad. Doctors were unsure what is causing it but they suspected a rare autoimmune disease. For 9 months he has been losing drastic amount of weight consistently every month. Starting from January 2024.

After September I felt hopeless. I tried recommending him to many different doctors and helping my Dad as much as I could and nothing was working. I cried and thought nothing is working and my dad can barely walk and eat or gain weight and the only option I have is to pray to God. I joined my school’s christian discord server and then left immediately. Then the host of the christian club dmed me shortly after and asked if I am looking for a christian club. I said yes, and she handed me a bible and a guide of what to read everyday.

The first time I read the bible with her I felt really calm and nice. I really liked the feeling.

I started reading the guide everyday and attending their prayer sessions. Everyday I prayed for my Dad to get better. I also started attending our city’s church every Sunday.

Then suddenly my mom messaged me that my Dad for the first time ever this year has gained 9lbs when he before was consistently losing weight every month. My mom also said my dad is much better now since the day I attended church the first time and is getting better everyday. And fyi I never told them which day I first attended church.

Then suddenly on the study guide it happened the same day that my mom said this the guide happen to read the verse: Hosea 11:3-4 NIV

“It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them.” (Hosea 11:3-4 NIV)

I started crying and I knew this verse meant that God and Jesus had healed my dad and wanted to let me know, this is too much of a coincidence to stumble upon this.

I prayed and cried thank you Jesus for helping my Dad. Praise the Lord, the Lord is great!

My dad has not made a full recovery but I will continue to pray for him to get better, and I would love if you could help pray for my Dad to get better as well! And I would love to pray for you guys as well!

I want to learn about things, not only because there is a revival going in China, of daoism and Buddhism. And it is my roots.. Also I want to learn about their beliefs and bring people to repentance in Christ. 
I just no longer want to stay ignorant of these things!
There are a lot of warnings in Bible about human philosophy, and idea and these things giving effects of demonic influence.
And us thinking we can have our ways, rather than God having his ways.

So I guess my question is that, can I learn about these things and seek to understand these things( Buddhism, Chinese medicine) WITHOUT LOSING MY PEACE?
I guess I will be committing the sin of doubt when I don’t do it in faith, which I struggle to have in these circumstances…
I have already done it in the past few weeks to try to read and study and learn about these things, with pure intention! 
But I get a convicting voice or feeling asking me to repent, and if I don’t, I get stress…

As I know at least for myself, I grew up knowing about God when I was a child but it wasn’t like I fully believed yet. Since it was more so me being told about him than me choosing myself to learn about him and put my faith in him. But as I got older, I started to yearn more for a relationship with him. I started to want to hear others' testimonies regarding him. A turning point for me was earlier this year when I, unfortunately, ended up losing my best friend after she cut ties with me for reasons I still don’t fully understand. Which really stung as she left me in a time of need. Around the time she left, I was fully unfortunately coming to terms with chronic illness. Something I am still struggling to accept today. But at least it gets easier some days, harder other days. Either way, I gotta keep going. My loneliness from it made me realize how far apart from God I had become. It also made me realize how fleeting human relationships can be compared to the relationship one has with the Lord. There’s a reason why there’s a saying that people come and go in your life. So I decided then I would grow in the Lord and hopefully become the best version of myself.

When Christ emptied himself and humbled himself leaving the Fathers side to come to earth as a servant who will then die, be buried, resurrect and then ascend back to the right hand of the Father. for all of humankind. The perfect, meek, humble, spotless lamb, the seed of David, Jesus came to unify us back with God.



In Genesis one God created man in His own likeness. In Genesis two we see God dwell perfectly with man. In Fact the Hebrew term to describe this event is ECHAD which is used only once in the entire bible. it takes place when God made Adam. The term means “known” as in God knows Adam so intensely and intimately because firstly, he is God, Secondly, God then knows everything about him.  sadly Genesis three happened and the first Sin takes place after Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit. Thus union/ perfect fellowship had been broken. In Genesis three its not all bad news though God leaves a Covenant, a Sealed promise to deliver the remedy for the now severed fellowship or union between God and man.



In both Matthew and Luke we see both Gospels accounts of the Genealogy of Jesus. From Adam to David, from David to Mary. Then in Luke chapter three we have the birth. Not a birth of that of royalty but of meekness and humility.



The incarnation of Christ or rather in simpler terms, the birth of Christ is important because among the Adamic Covenant there is four other covenants (exclude the Covenant with Noah) God himself promises a Savior who like I said in the first paragraph will come to earth to restore the fellowship man once had with God.  God did this because in first Peter The Author Peter tells us that God does not want anyone to perish.



However Jesus’ birth doesn't intently promise salvation to all. Yes Jesus died for all, yes God wishes everyone would be born again however in John chapter one John tells us that Jesus came to his own people (Jews) and some received him and some denied him. This was after the event of Matthew four of Jesus being tempted and tested by the devil. After Christ was victorious in this live action spiritual battle Christ started his public ministry. At age thirty-three Jesus says ""for the Kingdom is at hand. Repent and believe"" That Greek term for repent means to turn away your sins. To confess your sins to God ) he already knows them anyways) It's also a term that means you agree with the fact you are in desperate need of Christ as savior. Without Christ as Savior because of your sin you would and will go to hell. ""Believe"" this term indicates to Follow Jesus as Lord. believing in his divinity, his kingdom, his Lordship and to follow him as such. For example when he says in the sermon on the mount in Matthew Chapter five through seven he talks about the heart posture behind certain sins. His solution? Don't Sin, to take his words as his Commands. Another Example is to ""Love thy neighbor"" which is Christ's most famous words. We are to submit and obey.



His incarnation is God's extended hand at our return to intimate fellowship with him. That is Gospel: Good news.

Its true because I have seen Turkish Christians still justifying their ancestral warcrimes and wonder why Native Christians dont consider them as fellow Christians maybe they should take a look what their ancestors did not to just European but also other Native Christians during Ottoman rule. So, my message for Turkish Christians here is clear: acknowledge ancestral war crimes and advocate for Turkish government to return Native Christian churches instead of building more New Blood churches. 

The same goes for Azerbaijani Christians. Acknowledge war crimes stop building New Blood churches. New Blood implies for Christians who have no Christian ancestry. Also, return Native Christian cathedrals to Native Christians. I am tired of seeing Azerbaijani Christians virtue signaling in Armenian native churches.

Here's the scenario. You suddenly revive a message direct from God telling you Christ had already been reborn and who they are or was. And when you hear who it is you say ""oh, yeah, of course.""

A couple rules:

1) it has to be someone from during your life span, meaning they're either alive or were alive while you were alive.

2) they don't have to be Christian or male. That might be controversial with some but I think it's reasonable.

3) they have to be from your country. That's more of a suggestion to encourage more names the rest of us might not be familiar with.

4) they don't have to be a note worthy person.

4) you have to say why you think they are Christlike 

5) be serious...but not too serious.

I’ve turned my life to Christ this year and I’ve gotten more and more depressed every single day. I open this sub Reddit, oh did I swear that one time? Welp I sinned and I’m bad now. Did I play GTA V with friends and had fun playing and enjoy the game? Welp I sinned and I’m bad now. Did I drink for my 21st birthday?? Welp I sinned and im bad now. It’s all sin sin sin sin sin sin sin like im supposed to consistently be perfect while you all hide behind your judgmental texts like you are all perfect yet I know for a fact each and every one of you sin and then judges others like you are all perfect. I’m not perfect, I’m never going to be perfect, I sin every second. Then guess what, I see posts and YouTubers saying where you can’t keep repenting forever because one day god will just say he doesn’t know me and no matter how hard I tried, I will be banished to an eternity of suffering in hell. I’m depressed, this is the worst year of my life and my relationship with God has been perfection and helping me until I ended up seeing what all of you say. You judge and judge and judge, well guess what that’s a sin too. You are all sinners, none of you are perfect so stop acting like you all are. I despise this sub, it’s a pure evil sub where none of you actually care to help others but decide to judge. So yell at me, get angry at me, show your true selves in the replies because I know for a fact you will and you will end up showing your sin. I can’t take it anymore, I want to kill myself at this point because I’m gonna end up in hell no matter what because I keep uselessly repenting because I keep sinning. 

Edit: God bless you all. Every single one of you has been more than what I needed and craved for many months now, you’ve helped alleviate my pain, my suffering, and my sadness over me listening to the wrong people for so long when I should’ve put relationship with God over all. You are all loved, you are all not perfect and neither am I, but that’s what makes us perfect in the eyes of the Lord, because he knows that, and loves us no matter what. I will once again go back to choosing my relationship with Christ over religion theologies. You are all amazing, I will pray today for every single one of you, have to use your accounts in my prayers since I do not know your names haha, but you are all so amazing, you have no idea.

But I got a call from my Dad today that he ended up hospitalised with blood clots in his shoulder and lungs. They were small and he was prescribed blood thinners and discharged.
Further investigation into the blood clots will happen when he returns home.

Now a friend has to pick them up by car and my Dad stresses that everything is going to be okay.
But I’ve already lost my best friend to suicide, had cancer twice, r*ped in remission, ended up in a DV relationship that took years to recover from. Infertile from an ablation due to endometriosis at the age 23

This was the advice of all the wise and good men of the world, who especially in the days and periods of their joy and festival egressions chose to throw some ashes into their chalices, some sober remembrances of their fatal period. Such was the black shirt of Saladin, the tombstone presented to the Emperor of Constantinople on his coronation day, the Bishop of Rome's two reeds with flax and wax taper, the Egyptian skeleton served up at feasts, and Trimalcion's banquet in Petronius, in which was brought in the image of a dead man's bones of silver with spondiles exactly turning to every of the guests, and saying to every one, that you must die, and look not one upon another, for everyone is equally concerned in this sad representment.

-- The Right Reverend Father Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down and Connor

Bishop Jeremy, in his 17th century work *Holy Dying*, gives us sage advice for how we are to understand our mortality:

1. He that would be fearless of death must learn to despise the world; he must neither love any thing over-passionately, nor be exceeding proud of any circumstance of his life.

2. He that would not fear death must strengthen his spirit with the proper instruments of Christian fortitude. The religion of a Christian does more command fortitude, than ever did any institution; for we are commanded to be willing to die for Christ, to die for the brethren, to die rather than give offence or scandal; the effect of which is this: that he that is instructed to do the necessary parts of his duty is by the same instrument fortified against death.

3. Christian prudence is a great security against the fear of death. For if we be afraid of death it is but reasonable to use all spiritual arts to take off the apprehension of the evil; but therefore we ought to remove our fear, because fear gives to death wings and spurs and darts. Death hastens to a fearful man; if therefore you would make death harmless and slow, then to throw off fear is the way to do it, and prayer is the way to do that.

4. If thou wilt be fearless of death, endeavour to be in love with the felicities of Saints and Angels, and be once persuaded to believe that there is a condition of living better then this, that there are creatures more noble then we, that above there is a country better then ours, that the inhabitants know more and know better, and are in places of rest and desire.

5. If God should say to us, 'Cast thyself into the sea (as Christ did to St. Peter, or as God concerning Jonah); I have provided for thee a dolphin, or a whale, or a port, a safety or a deliverance, security or a reward', were we not incredulous and pusillanimous persons if we should tremble to put such a felicity into act, and our selves into possession? The very duty of resignation, and the love of our own interest are good antidotes against fear.

6. Make no excuses to make thy desires of life seem reasonable, neither cover thy fear and pretences; but suppress it rather with arts of severity and ingenuity. Some are not willing to submit to God's sentence and arrest of death, till they have finished such a design, or made an end of the last paragraph of their book, or raised such portions for their children, or preached so many sermons, or built their house, or planted their orchard, or ordered their estate with such advantages. It is well for the modesty of these men that the excuse is ready; but if it were not, it is certain they would search one out, for an idle man is never ready to die, and is glad of any excuse, and a busied man hath always something unfinished, and he is ready for everything but death. Say no more, but when God calls, lay aside thy papers and first dress thy soul, and then dress thy hearse.

And then he continues:

> After all this, I do not say it is a sin to be afraid of death; we find the boldest spirit that discourses of it with confidence, and dares undertake a danger as big as death, yet doth shrink at the horror of it when it comes dressed in its proper circumstances. Our Blessed Lord was pleased to legitimately fear by his agony and prayers in the garden. It is not a sin to be afraid, but it is a great felicity to be without fear, which felicity our dearest Saviour refused to have, because it was agreeable to his purposes to suffer any thing that was contrary to felicity, every thing but sin. Therefore possess yourselves in patience, with reason, and religion, and you shall die with ease.

Finally, advice for mourners, and those that would seek to turn from the death of sin to the life of Christ:

> When we have received the last breath of our friend and closed his eyes, and composed his body for the grave, then seasonable is the counsel of the son of Sirach: 'Weep bitterly and make great moan, and use lamentation as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of; and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness. But take no grief to heart; for there is no turning again, thou shall not do him good, but hurt thy self'.

To die in the Lord, he concludes, is a good death, for to live in the Lord is life.",0,True,,,1.0,False,

one of the passages was about miracles and that we should count them and remember, as they strengthen our faith.

I remember 1 miracle that happened to me: 
was at one of  the big meeting in Germany. it was about asking forgiveness of Germany past in WOII, and at the same time other country people giving forgiveness if i remember well. Then a happy Christian music was played and the admosphere was just happy.

You have to know , i was never a dancing person, could only move left then move right. But at at meeting with a few hundred people the Holy spirit helped me to dance. I remember i turned, jumped, and did more and more moves. There was no thinking, i just moved. I heard from others my dance was actually nice to look at. no one knew i cannot dance at all, no one knows but God. 

I just need to pray again, remember what God has done and pray for more faith and actions throught me.

please share your miracles if you like. Let's ask God to increase  our faith and let use it.

We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ ²³ But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’

Matthews 7:23: But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’ is referring to those saying Gods work is their work (entitlement, Philippians 2:5–8) it talks about how people boast about they're 'successes' with their religion when in reality, it's Gods successes that we as Christians decided to act on.

It also is saying that those who claim to be a Christian, but don't do His works, read their bible, don't seek forgiveness, give into the world, u will be banished to the darkness.

Boy, am I sick of this emotional blackmail.

Listen up, people:

A Democrat can be a good Christian. A Republican can be a good Christian.

A Democrat can be a good POTUS. A Republican can be a good POTUS.

And most of all, we are not voting for a CHRISTIAN leader.  We are voting for a POLITICAL leader.  A person can be a good POTUS without being a Christian at all, and he or she can also be a devout Christian but a lousy POTUS.

Questioning or criticizing a presidential candidate's religious views is only a dishonest political ploy.  It's used by some people of distracting and confusing voters from the REAL questions, which are What kind of POTUS would this person be? and Does this candidate care more about what's best for this NATION, than about his or her own career or reputation?

I've been a Christian for more than forty years. The qualities I want most in my President are CHARACTER and INTEGRITY.  I would rather vote for a honest man or woman with whom I disagreed, than for a candidate who says what I might enjoy hearing, but doesn't mean a word of it.

The internet resource is not someone to be trusted, as it sexualizes anybody who is formally in a position that shouldn’t be sexualized in any partitioning. The worser part about the sexual adaptation is that the character is a child, so it is basically child sexualization every time one sexualizes the character. This could possibly perverse my beliefs, or even defame the entire religious idealisms as a whole. I’m completely devastated over this. Hopefully, people will acknowledge that the character is a child.

My name is Noah and I’ve been recently looking into Christianity for a while. I’ve adopted the “Cultural Christian” identity right now. I’ve been an agnostic for a long time. I’ve always noticed the “Jesus loves you” messages on social media or other platforms, and I’ve usually denounced it. However, I need guidance. I’ve recently accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I know this doesn’t fit into the context of “Cultural Christian”, however I just have. I accept His love. The issue is that, through it all, I see how scientists react to the idea of Christianity and religion in general. They deem faith as having a pointless belief that can be also interpreted as foolish. It also cannot be proven or disproven that God is real. Each side (theist and atheist) both point fingers at one another and call each other foolish. I’m lost. 

I am very scientific in my understanding of the world. I use science as a means of understanding and interpreting the world around me (as anyone should!). My favorite subject is Astronomy as it delves into Chemistry, Physics and the unknown. Christianity has always seemed that way to me. A delve into the unknown. Atheists use the argument that using scripture as a means of evidence for Jesus Christ is ridiculous and that it’s foolish. I don’t see why we can’t have both? Why cannot it write like so: “Science is the how of the world and God is the why.” I always see scientists and theists go head to head, when it doesn’t need to be this way. People make me feel foolish for believing in God. I know not to take into account of their opinion, however, it’s hard to do so. 

My main issue is this; how do I determine the validity of God? It’s impossible. I cannot understand God. So why do Christians feel as if they understand God? The Bible is the word of God? Then why has it been rewritten so extensively by the Church? Organized religion, to me, has always been viewed as a means to control masses of people with the excuse of “God”. 

I don’t know what’s going on brothers. My brain is very focused on evidence and reasoning rather than blind faith. I would really appreciate if someone could guide me.

They never make demands of you.

They are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor.

They don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct.

Unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy.

Unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare.

Unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike.

They allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships, and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn.

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without reimagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe.

Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.

We're divided; Not just politically but from the word of what our lord and savior commanded and told us. He told us to love each other as much as ourselves! And in loving one another we are loving him. In forgiving each other we are forgiven by him! People everywhere; Christian and non Christian, should come to realize when they view the world it's not at a state we want and it never will truly be until Judgement day. It gets worse!! And eventually comfortable in sin and rejection. That's why it's important to do things and live for God now! Rather than spend half a lifetime or longer figuring out our world and how it should run correctly. Because it will NEVER run correctly if we do it. People in the bible appointed by God himself still did wrong and led wrong. If you want to satisfy YOUR world view; don't. Because it never mattered what you or I wanted. It's what Jesus Christ desired for us. He understood our needs not just with the benefit of hindsight, but because his intentions were always centered on us. Love God fully. As well as your neighbor. And you can live out truth that lasts forever rather than lies and wickedness that lasts the seasons of this world until it's end. We will disagree and fall and belittle or even hurt each other and I'm not expecting this reddit post to change the world. I'm expecting it to Bring people to What their calling is from The Lord. Rather than what their Worldy calling is. We aren't here forever. Make use of that time God appointed you. For all you know: Today or tonight is your last truthful descions or dishonest sins. You reap what you sow. The wages of sin is death. And I ask you if you want to find Christ and be in his calling and change TRUTHFULLY and find your purpose and salvation. It can be found on faith as small as a mustard seed. And done with words that tremble. If that's you. Read this:

Gospel Message:

The Gospel is the good news that God loves you and desires a relationship with you. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the punishment for our sins, offering forgiveness and the promise of eternal life. By believing in Jesus and accepting His sacrifice, we can be reconciled to God and transformed from the inside out. Jesus Christ had you in mind when he died. Yes YOU. Satan never knew you'd be here. But Jesus did. He did this for you.

The salvation prayer that will Start your new life. You will be born again With the Holy Spirit, and God's help.This is your salvation

Your Salvation Prayer:

Heavenly Father, I come to You with a humble heart, recognizing my need for Your grace. I confess my sins and turn away from my old ways. I believe that Jesus Christ is Your Son, who died for my sins and rose again to give me new life. 

I ask You to forgive me and cleanse me from all unrighteousness. I surrender my life to You and invite Your Holy Spirit to guide me in living according to Your will. Help me to grow in faith and become the person You created me to be.

Thank You for Your love and mercy. I commit my life to You today. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.

I sit in bed a lot and just feel like I'm wasting time instead of being a servant to God.

I'm tired of sitting around not being able to do anything and spread the righteousness of God by my doings.

It feels like everyone around me got their lifes ahead of them. My nieces and nephews can already drive but I don't even have my permit yet, I'm a 20 year old woman.

I want to start getting better, I've already had a long conversation with God. I want to get back in my feet and do what I love again, for God has gifted me with so much talent and potential, and I want to show everyone the gifts God gave me.

I feel like a lot of people can relate to this, especially after the pandemic everything just changed. I missed half my teenhood because of quarantine, I was looking forward a lot of things. But I know God has plans for me and he would never give me anything I can't handle.

I'm really lucky to have God in my life and I ask him to make me stronger, use the sins I have done and use them as stepping stones to get closer to him and build a better relationship with him.

God places obstacles in our life, it's kinda like rock climbing. Sometimes you may slip, but you have to ground yourself and find the next hold God placed for you.  

But rock climbing ain't easy though nor is life, however with God by my side I know I can get through it. I just need to get better and take control again, prove to God that I am his daughter and I will follow the light that shines for me.

Thank you God and thank for anyone reading this, God bless you. I just had some things to get off my chest and share, I think it's good for others to talk to each other, as God places people in our life's as vessels.

The belief is that “i don’t really know or believe if God truly wants good things for me, or if I’m deserving of them… bc of xyz”. 

My experience in life has been hard. 

I lost my dad at a young age, and then lost my mom at 24. 
My uncles stole our inheritance money, so i had nothing to take. 
I used to be a well known worship leader but my worship manager had some beef with me and kicked me off the team causing some trauma and betrayal.

I moved to a new state, and it’s been thr hardest 3 years of my life. I got laid off but it was a blessing because i ended up changing my career. 
I got a new job and was promised a 20k raise, only for them to change their minds and still give me the work. 
My dream apartment flooded and forced to find a crappy apartment. Unfortunately cost of living is so high it’s the only thing i can afford until i get more money. 

I don’t have any family to spend thanksgiving or Christmas with. 

I’m a very beautiful active young adult, and people don’t know how much i struggle on the inside. 

I have also been dealing with chronic illness for 20 years, for the most part management with drugs. 

I am single and desire to be a godly wife. But dating has been hard in the new city, a lot of men have a hard time communicating for some reason. 

Can u help me with these beliefs? I want to believe god has good for me but it’s hard for me. I want to have hope that i can somewhat enjoy life while I’m on earth, even if not in total prosperity. 

TLDR: does God want me to be happy or to suffer and not have good things? It seems like no matter how hard i try i can’t seem to get happy or be at peace. ",12,True,,,1.0,False,

Kinda interesting it’s almost every other day I see something pop up on some platform of a believer saying or asking something like this? 

Now when I was younger I used to draw demons and stuff but kinda have been steering away from it for many years now just because quite frankly it’s kinda taxing to stare at these things for that extended amount of time.  

What I have been finding interesting is when I search up old paintings depicting hell demons devils etc there is a vast extensive hundreds if not maybe even thousands of years of art of this type of stuff? What was very odd is it seems many of these artists where believers who made these things? Another peculiar thing was some of this art used to even be shown in Churches? 

Some reason I’m having a hard time finding any sermons on this matter? It’s interesting how believers in the past used to depict these things a lot but it seems in our modern age it’s more rare if not frowned upon? 

There are some YouTube videos I found that went into some of the lore of older art that depicted hell and demons etc. What stood out to me was he said that many modern day video games have been inspired by some of this artwork but what’s interesting is that we no longer tie it with Christianity now?

1gfwvsf,Is the second beast from Revelation 13 Mammon?,pharmakos144,2024-10-30 20:47:47+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gfwvsf/is_the_second_beast_from_revelation_13_mammon/,0,/r/Christianity/comments/1gfwvsf/is_the_second_beast_from_revelation_13_mammon/,Christianity,"The average credit score in the United States hovers around 666. This number is striking, not only because it’s well-known as the “number of the beast” in the Book of Revelation, but because it also happens to be the general threshold most creditors require for participation in modern economic life. In Revelation 13:16-18, it’s said that without the second beast's “mark""—“his name or his number”—one cannot buy or sell. How intriguing, then, that today a credit score, this numerical “mark,” is necessary for access to loans, mortgages, renting, and even some jobs. Much like in the prophecy, those without the required number find themselves cut off from economic participation. But what might this modern-day mark represent beyond the number itself?

This financial control is deeply connected to a larger force: Mammon. In the Christian tradition, Mammon is understood not just as wealth but as an idol of materialism and greed. When wealth and debt become our ultimate concerns, Mammon takes over as a guiding force, demanding that we serve it to sustain our livelihoods. Today, through credit systems, debt obligations, and financial dependence, Mammon effectively becomes the second beast, coercing people into a web of economic dependence. Under Mammon’s influence, people are drawn into cycles of debt and consumerism, their worth increasingly defined not by spiritual character but by financial metrics like credit scores. This phenomenon reflects Mammon’s role as a controller of allegiance, drawing people away from true spiritual freedom and into servitude to financial institutions and economic power.

Revelation 13 also says that this second beast will lead those that worship it to also worship the first beast in the passage -- the first beast being commonly interpreted as a symbol for political or imperial power.  In other words, as we give more allegiance to Mammon and it's systems of control, an insidious shift takes place: loyalty to God is replaced by loyalty to the state and economy. In the United States, this can be seen in the replacement of traditional worship with a new form of reverence—faith in the government, the economic system, and national identity. In this sense, nationalism and economic status have become intertwined, creating a world where our identity is shaped by productivity, financial worth, and political loyalty. This devotion to the state, with its economic and social demands, pulls us further away from spiritual integrity and forces us into conformity with a system that values economic participation over spiritual well-being.

But it doesn’t stop there. Revelation also distinguishes between the “number” and the “name” of the beast, which are each said to permit economic access. This could represent a dual system in our world today: one path for the masses, who must strive to maintain a credit score (or a financial “number”) high enough to participate fully in society; and another path for those born into privilege, whose family “name” exempts them from these same financial standards. In our current world, nepotism and legacy wealth -- essentially generationally inherited Mammon worship -- allows certain families to bypass the rules most people have to follow. They’re not held to the same standards, shielded by inherited status and connections, granting them economic participation without needing to earn the same financial “number” as others. This distinction between “number” and “name” is hauntingly relevant, underscoring how family connections can serve as a mark of privilege, insulating a select few from the trials faced by ordinary people who are bound by the financial system’s demands.

In this way, the forces described in Revelation 13 seem to unfold before us in economic structures that many of us take for granted, revealing a two-tiered system where those marked by financial worth can thrive, while others are kept out—left to the margins by systems of control that ultimately serve Mammon. Our credit scores, our debt, and our economic survival have become markers of allegiance, quietly replacing faith in God with devotion to material concerns. If we are to recognize these signs for what they are, it’s crucial that we reflect on what we’re truly worshiping: are we serving God, or have we unwittingly become servants to the economic and political forces that control us?

Our age is one where we are constantly encouraged to believe that success and worth are tied to our ability to consume, to buy, to keep up. The Bible offers a stark warning that, in this world, we must be cautious not to let Mammon and state power erode our souls, leading us into systems of worship that are economic rather than spiritual. Let this realization be a call for awareness, a moment to question what we value, and to examine the powerful systems that demand our allegiance. By recognizing these systems for what they are, we can reclaim our spiritual freedom and step back from the brink before it’s too late.",6,True,,,0.4,False,

Okay so, some explanation. I know this may not perfectly fit the lens of Christianity, but I wasn't sure what other subreddit to talk about this on, so I thank you for your time guys. I've always been an atheist because my family was not religious and believed I should follow whichever religion I saw fit when I became old enough to understand it. I've been experiencing the most inexplicable things recently, which have steered me towards believing God, and I like to believe Mother Nature as well, are in fact real. A couple weeks ago, spontaneously, the phrase ""I fear nothing but my God"" came into my head while I was anxious, and ever since then I've been able to relieve myself of stress by repeating that phrase, like He is protecting me. This was really weird because I've never felt secure in a religious figure like that. Also, things like pentagrams or upside down crosses never stirred me before, but now seeing them I feel disgust and a need to ask God to forgive whoever messes around with that stuff. Again, I've hardly spoken to God let alone felt a need to ask that he forgives somebody, so I was intrigued. I've also found myself going on morning walks to appreciate and worship Mother Nature and Father God for the beautiful land and people they have blessed me with, and talking to them like this fills me with joy for the day. I think what really hit this home for me was a time where I was feeling really depressed a while back and was thinking about how nice it would be to see a cat or a dog right then (animals are a huge comfort for me), and then out of nowhere since that day I've seen a huge influx of friendly strays appearing wherever I go, seemingly in perfect coincidental timing with when I am scared or depressed or upset. Anyway, super long word vomit short, it feels like at the very least some derivative of God and Nature are passing blessings onto me and I want to know how to do right by them. Now here's some questions I have.  


1. How do you guys know that your God is speaking to you? Personally, I've found that if I pray, I get the sensation of a hand on my back or tingling in my arms, plus a weight off of my shoulders. What about you?

2. Is it okay that I ask God for strength or guidance? Like I'm not being greedy or a nuisance or a burden? I think because I was atheist for so long, I feel bad asking, because it feels like I'm just asking some person for an annoying favour.

3. Are there specific habits that you guys had to drop when coming to follow God? Is there anything weirdly niche that I should be careful of avoiding?

4. Is it normal to feel embarrassed when telling people I'm beginning to believe now? I feel awful for being embarrassed to share that I have faith in someone who sacrificed so much for us.

5. Is it okay if I'm a ""quiet"" believer? If I don't pursue a mission or spreading it, but I still read a bible and pray/worship and feel confident in my faith, is that enough?

6. Do you guys have any bible verses you particularly like? Anything super standing-out to you as favourites?  


Thank you guys again very much for your time if anybody does read this. I appreciate the help! :)

I feel unworthy to take communion because I’ve been living a lifestyle of unrepentant willful sin, and I haven’t been listening when I feel God leading me to do something. I feel like I’m truly not right with God, and like in my heart I’m against Him. 

The church I attend (non-denominational) takes communion once a month, usually at the beginning of the month. For a long time I’ve felt like I shouldn’t take communion because of where I’m at spiritually, and how there’s a verse that mentions that people have passed away and brought a curse upon themselves by taking communion unworthily (1 Corinthians 11:27). A couple months ago I took communion and I shouldn’t have, and that night I had a dream that there was a dark being that represented death standing several feet away from me, but in my dream and real life I was thinking that I wasn’t ready to die. 

I feel stressed and anxious because I don’t want to take communion and bring a curse or worse upon myself, and like whenever someone mentions taking communion I feel worked up and like I want to avoid it. 

I attend church with other people in my family though, and I want to mention to them that I shouldn’t take communion, but I don’t want to share with them where I’m at spiritually because how I’m living isn’t right. 

Last night I dreamt that I was at church with someone in my family, and they were taking communion. Originally I didn’t have the elements, but then someone handed them to me and the person I go to church with. I woke up before I took communion in the dream, but the dream felt like real life.

being a layperson in this field, I am honestly puzzled why there is a plethora of logical fallacies (argument from silence, circular reasoning etc) in the field of New Testament studies. Furthermore, what behooves me is the notion of ""internal evidence"", when as I've shown below, arguments such as Editorial fatigue is easy to reverse in favour of a Matthean priority (Matthew was written first)

Quite frankly, a lot of these arguments can go both ways. Enjoy!

# Was there one loaf or no loaf?

|Matthew 16:5-8|Mark 8:14-17|
|:-|:-|
|^(5) When the disciples reached the other side, **they had forgotten to bring any bread.**   ^(6) Jesus said to them, “Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”   ^(7) And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, “We brought **no bread**.”   ^(8) But Jesus, aware of this, said, [^(r)](https://www.esv.org/Mt6.30)“O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have **no bread**?|^(14) Now they had forgotten to bring bread, **and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.**   ^(15) And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”   ^(16) And they began discussing with one another the fact that they **had no bread.**   ^(17) And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have **no bread?**|

Explanation: Mark begins by stating that the disciples had only one loaf with them in the boat, whereas Matthew says that they “had forgotten to bring any bread” (basically, they had no bread). Matthew maintains the “no bread” situation, while Mark seemingly lapses into a “no bread” situation” after copying Matthew

# Shake the dust off the sandals or feet?

|Luke 9:3-5|Mark 6:8-11|
|:-|:-|
|^(3) And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.   ^(4) And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.   ^(5) And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town **shake off the dust from your feet** as a testimony against them.”|^(8) He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—   ^(9) **but to** \*\*wear sandals and not put on two tunics.\*\*^(10) And he said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.   ^(11) And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, **shake off the dust that is on your feet** as a testimony against them.”   ^(12) So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.  ^(13) And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.|

Explanation: Mark starts them off with saying that the disciples had sandals, but then later in the passage seems to lapse into lazily copying Luke by referencing “shake off the dust that is on your feet”. He goes from a sandals situation to a no-sandals situation.

# Mark relapsing on the Synagogue Official?

|Matthew 9:18/9:23-26|Mark 5:22-23/5:35-38|
|:-|:-|
|^(18) While he was saying these things to them, behold, **a synagogue official** came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”    ^(23) And when Jesus came to **the** **synagogue official’s house** and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,   ^(24) he said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him.   ^(25) But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.   ^(26) And the report of this went through all that district.|^(22) Then came **one of** **the officials of the synagogue, Jairus by name**, and seeing him, he fell at his feet   ^(23) and implored him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.”   …  ^(35) While he was still speaking, there came from **the synagogue official** house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why [^(r)](https://www.esv.org/Lk7.6)trouble [^(s)](https://www.esv.org/Jn11.28)the Teacher any further?”   ^(36) But overhearing[^(5)](https://www.esv.org/Mark+5/#f5-) what they said, Jesus said to **the synagogue official**, “Do not fear, only believe.”   ^(37) And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.   ^(38) They came to **the synagogue official**, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. |

Explanation: Mark begins by referring to the synagogue official as “Jairus”, but as continues later in the passage, he never refers to Jairus by his name again. Instead, he appears to be lapsing into copying Matthew and refers to him generically as synagogue “official.” 

# Rewards?

|Matthew 10:40-42|Mark 9:38-41|
|:-|:-|
|^(40) [^(z)](https://www.esv.org/Lk10.16%3BJn13.20%3BGa4.14%3BMt10.20%3BMt18.5%3BMt25.40)“Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.   ^(41) The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.   ^(42) And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by **no means lose his reward.”**|^(38) John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”   ^(39) But Jesus said, “Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.   ^(40) For the one who is not against us is for us.  ^(41) For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will **by no means lose his reward.**|

Elaboration: In the case of Matthew, it makes sense for Jesus to state “he will by no means lose his reward” because the preceding verse talks about receiving a “righteous person’s reward” 

However, in the case of Mark, there was no such context- instead,the disciples were talking about “casting out demons in his name” and suddenly, Mark has ‘editorial fatigue’ and goes into talking about losing a reward out of the blue!

# Did Jesus answer ONLY Peter or ALL the disciples?

|Matthew 21:20-22|Mark 11:20-22|
|:-|:-|
|^(20) **When the disciples saw it**, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”   ^(21) And Jesus answered **them**, “Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.  ^(22) And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, [^(y)](https://www.esv.org/Mt7.7)if you have faith.”|^(20) As **they** passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots  ^(21) And **Peter** remembered and said to **him**, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”  ^(22) And Jesus answered **them**, “Have faith in God.|

Elaboration: In Mark, it was Peter who asked the question. However, Mark seemingly forgets that it wasn’t the disciples, but ONLY Peter, who asks the question and relapses into using the plural (“them”)

# Who’s “they” in Mark?

|Matthew 24:29-31|Mark 11:24-27|
|:-|:-|
|^(29) “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and [^(q)](https://www.esv.org/Rv6.13%3BIs14.12%3BIs34.4)the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.   ^(30) Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, **and then** **all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and** **they** will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.   ^(31) And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.|^(24) “But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, ^(25) and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. ^(26) And then **they** will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.   ^(27) And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.|

Elaboration: In Matthew, using “they” makes sense because it’s a reference to “all the tribes of the earth” that will mourn and THEY will see the Son of Man coming. But in Mark’s case, Mark fatigues when copying Matthew as the “they” comes out of nowhere and doesn’t make sense, as he omits the “tribes of the earth”",11,True,Blog,blog,0.67,False,Blog

So I wonder what other people think.

1. Obviously there would have been nobody else with Jesus witnessing these so Jesus would have to tell his disciples about his temptations. 
2. However it is not written as durect Jesus speech like ""Jesus said: I went to the desert and this happened"". It is written from a 3rd person like many apocrypha were. Which is why it feels like it is not actually a direct story from Jesus.
3. It is not really teaching disciples anything just showing how great Jesus was for resisting temptation. Which seems like it would be kind of petty to brag about to disciples. 
4. It doesn't fit at all with Jesus being God. There is no way to ""tempt"" a perfect God because God would be free from the vices by definition. Furthemore there is nothing anyone could tempt an omnipotent God with, especially with wealth. Jesus could perform literal miracles so what would he need wealth for?

Ultimately to me it feels like an extra story added later to make Jesus seem more legitimate as a Messiah.

The other such addition to me is the part where Jesus talks with Moses and Elijah.

1. Since we are not getting much direct speech the only purpose this serves is to just legitimize Jesus. Neither Moses not Elijah actually say anything that would warrant them appearing to everyone. 
2. Since Jesus is God there is not much he would need to actually tell those two or learn from them.
3. Moses is guilty of killing and enslaving an entire nation of people who lived on the territory. Also see Numbers 31 for more attrocities. It is up to you how to reconcile this with Christianity but to me Moses is an obvious war criminal and slaver and I doubt Jesus if he being a perfect God would need to talk to him at all.
4. Same goes for Elijah. After performing his miracle proving that his God was the real one he then killed the opposing priests that he just proved wrong. Why not offer them conversion instead? Seems like an incredibly vicious thing to do.

In both cases it seems like they would be people whose actions Jesus would condemn not ones he would summon to prove his legitimacy.",4,True,,,0.5,False,

Sounds like it was originally written about the time that the earliest Christians would have been starting to wonder why Jesus had not returned and perhaps starting to lose faith that he ever would.  Jesus's followers  were being persecuted and being told not to worry as Jesus was going to return, yet as time went on, no sign of Jesus coming back to save them. 

It also seems entirely out of character with the rest of Jesus's teachings emphasising love, compasion, and forgiveness.  Instead it seems like it might be called the book of Revenge rather than Revelation.  The day when Jesus comes back and those persecutors are going to get theirs.

\-Apparent synchronicities that appear in the Bible that seem divine. (The numbers)

* Things that always pop up on the internet/discussion, like archeologists have just recently found out that Roman’s actually crucified people in Jesus’ time.

  
I just feel like every time I read the bible I can't help but spot inconsistences, and it keeps bothering me. Like a lot of the ""prophecies"" in Psalms about Jesus seem to be about his own woes if you read the chapter in its entirety.

I am well versed in the Bible and I have my opinion on how things should be interpreted, but my neighbor interprets the Bible completely differently than I do, bringing in gods/demons from other religions into how she explains how her spiritual attacks affect her. She tells her lucid dreams are to be taken as something to come in the future. She reads the Bible all through to the day and night, and when she dreams something scary she tells me it’s a spiritual attack. Now I do wholeheartedly believe it is a spiritual attack just not in the way she thinks it is. 

Now I personally think she has just jumped into Christianity all too fast and she’s battling her demons and interpreting her battles with demons as possible ‘propheteering’. It’s not uncommon for people who are trying to start their walk with God to fall short, myself included, I am personally in a constant battle with things I don’t feel comfortable to disclose here. I was like that too but I went through that phase pretty early in life not as an adult. But am I wrong for not wanting to share her opinion with her ‘calling?’ Because to me she just seems like a crazy conspiracy theorist who is having lucid dreams about her most recent fixation. She reads the Bible everyday she compares her dreams to what she’s read in the Bible and my first thought is to say “well you know children who watch something scary right before bed end up having nightmares about it” instead of taking her seriously.  To clarify it only rubs me the wrong way in a religious level. She’s a really great woman and I don’t have any terrible opinions on her I just don’t know how to explain to her how I feel about her revelations without hurting her feelings or her walk with god. I don’t feel like I’m the right person spiritually to tell her she’s wrong if she even is wrong. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to approach/avoid the topic without sounding like I don’t believe in God I do I just don’t understand or believe how she’s interpreted it for herself.

Getting mad at your real world brothers and sisters over 2 candidates that don't know who you are is crazy to me. There are literally people that ended friendships ans relationships  over their vote or beliefs. This just goes to show as Christians ALL PEOPLE have thoughts of their own.There are democrats that don't always agree with other democrats and Republicans that don't always agree with other Republicans. And there are Christians that don't always agree with other Christians.  Even so, that's okay. As a free thinker you are free to do that. Now I understand Democrats and Republicans have constant disagreement, it's always over the news. But understand why that is- dissonance brings forth strong emotions. These strong emotions are taken advantage of by the media and politicians in order to generate emotions that encourage you to take their desired action(s) Vote for me, vote for them. Vote Red or Blue up and down the ticket blah blah blah Red or blue- these seem like sports teams thinking logically.  Sure Republicans believe in pro life and Democrats believe in pro choice. This is just one of the many issues the 2 parties have. However if we genuinely discussed it im sure there could be a common ground reached (if politicians discussed it) but both parties need dissonance in order to inspire their constituents so you won't hear many ""we see a common ground on this."" As Christians we may all read the same Bible but you'd be hard-pressed to find 100 Christian that see everything's completely the same. Yet we can all agree to treat others with love and respect no matter what party you support.

It's also important to realize people often don't support a candidates over everything the candidate believes or does. Something that is a deal breaker for you, may not matter to the other person. I know that can be difficult to accept and understand but it's the truth. There will also be political parties that will use their candidates ""faith"" or their target voters faith and project it on them strictly for your vote. Whoever you vote for reach out to those you care about and tell them you love them. Seek understanding through discussion if you genuine want insight. But keep it civil, that makes us better as individual people.

Lyrics:

When it's all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here
Under the sun, I found we were left to drown
Evil abounds, weight is pullin' us down
No sight or sound, impaired to His care
Chasing after the wind, running after the air
Deserving of desertion, servants of destruction
And everyday we taste of a grace that we're unconcerned with
My sin I should be burned with, I'm guilty, filthy, and stained
But He became a curse, drank my cup and took my pain
And for that He reigns, through faith I'm changed
And I don't have a reason why He loosened up my chains
I don't believe in luck; I believe in Grace
But they say we're lucky cause we seen His face
And we heard Him call us, and He heard our answer
And He gives us second chances when we throw our hands up
So weary and broken, hopin' His arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into His focus
(I guess we the luck ones, huh?)
When it's all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here
You're greater than my shame, guilt, my doubt, and my past
Fortunate to trust in you cause I've doubted your plans
I've questioned your ways, every question I raised
Is foolishness compared to mountains, the wind, and the waves
You're so mindful of us, we rise from the dust
You love these cheating, beating hearts and these eyes full of lust
Gave us power to fight it, though we cower in quiet
We have the faith to start a riot; how can we deny it?
Fire inside us that you kindle when it starts to dwindle
And simply put I'm sinful so your love is essential
I don't believe in luck, no, I believe in Grace
But they say we lucky cause we seen your face
Lord, we heard you call us, You heard our answer
And you give us second chances when we throw our hands up
I'm weary and broken, but your arms will be open
Unconditional love has got us locked into your focus
See, I'm not sayin' I'm always right
I know ain't always right
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect
And I know I ain't perfect
And I know I don't deserve it
I surely know I don't deserve this
But I'm glad I got this life
But you love me
I'm glad that I got it
You love me and you forgive me
And it makes me a lucky one
Thank you thank you
I can't imagine this kinda love
I can't imagine this kinda Grace
I guess that's what they call us the lucky ones, huh?
When it's all said and done
You and I are the lucky ones
We fought many
And we'll fight the night until we see the sun
We are the lucky ones
We are the lucky ones
We are here",0,True,Video,video,0.67,False,Video

Welcomes You To : 

Prayer Program: 30 October 2024

Theme: Prayer That Works (4)

Scripture: Ps.34:4-22; Rom.8:2; 

2 Tim. 1:7 & Luk. 5:13

Message:

Decrees in Action

He goes before us and makes the rough places smooth, shattering all resistance.

He gives us the treasures of darkness (souls, healings, deliverances) and hidden wealth of secret places (favor, grace, anointing) so that we know it is the Lord our God who calls us by name to fulfill this assignment.

Jesus often used this principle in His ministry. For example, we read in Luke 5:13 about a leper who had come to Jesus. He was full of devastating leprosy, but Jesus decreed, “Be cleansed.” Immediately the leper was cleansed; his leprosy was gone. The decree of Jesus' Word brought forth cleansing, healing, and restoration that had not existed previously.

Decree Freedom in Christ:

The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set us free from the law of sin and death. In Christ, we live and move and have our being. He is our Refuge and our Fortress, our God, in Whom we trust.

# 1. Introduction: Differentiating Contemporary Sophianism from Russian Sophiology

In the study of Sophia, or divine wisdom, Russian Sophiology presents an alluring yet problematic perspective. Figures like Sergei Bulgakov and Vladimir Solovyov describe Sophia as a quasi-divine figure, even suggesting that she may hold a “fourth hypostasis” alongside the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This approach elevates Sophia in a way that risks blurring the essential distinction between Creator and creation, positioning her as an almost-divine presence within the Trinity.

In Contemporary Sophianism, we offer a different understanding, one rooted in both reverence and theological precision. **Sophia, as we interpret her, is a created spirit of wisdom, not a member of the Godhead.** Her nature and purpose are distinct: while she embodies God’s wisdom, she is a reflection—a created “mirror”—of divine wisdom, not its source. This distinction allows us to recognize Sophia’s profound influence without elevating her to a status that could encroach on Christ’s unique role as redeemer.

Moreover, Contemporary Sophianism holds that Sophia’s work in our lives is different from salvation in the redemptive sense. Christ alone provides the salvation that reconciles us to God, restoring our souls for eternal life. Sophia’s role, rather than redeeming, is one of guidance, a “saving” influence that protects and aligns us with God’s path in the practical sense of life’s decisions and directions. Through her wisdom, we are saved from destructive choices, from purposelessness, and from paths that might distance us from our true purpose—but her work does not redeem our souls.

This foundational distinction is at the heart of Contemporary Sophianism. By preserving Sophia’s created status and understanding her guidance as separate from salvation, we honour both her exalted role and the unique, unparalleled power of Christ’s redeeming love. In the following sections, we will explore this distinction in depth, examining how Contemporary Sophianism holds a clear, harmonious vision of Sophia’s guiding wisdom and Christ’s saving grace.

# 2. Russian Sophiology’s View of Sophia and the Distinction in Contemporary Sophianism

In Russian Sophiology, theologians like Vladimir Solovyov and Sergei Bulgakov present Sophia as a figure of divine wisdom who occupies a uniquely elevated status. According to their interpretation, Sophia is sometimes described as a **“fourth hypostasis”**—a distinct, almost divine presence that stands alongside the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This view positions Sophia as more than just a created being or an attribute of God; rather, she is seen as a quasi-divine entity, integral to God’s work in creation and mediating between the uncreated and the created.

For Russian Sophiologists, Sophia represents the feminine aspect of divine wisdom, embodying both God’s immanence and transcendence. She is often viewed as a bridge between God and creation, a cosmic principle that not only reflects God’s wisdom but also participates in it in a way that suggests inherent divinity. In their view, Sophia is a presence who *holds* or *contains* the wisdom of God, actively mediating divine truth to creation.

However, this interpretation presents theological challenges, particularly when it comes to maintaining a clear distinction between Creator and creation. By positioning Sophia so close to the Trinity, Russian Sophiology risks implying that she shares in the uncreated nature of God. This approach dilutes the theological boundaries between God’s essence and created beings, suggesting that Sophia could be seen as part of the divine nature rather than a creature who reflects it. This ambiguity leaves open questions about Sophia’s role in salvation and redemption, potentially positioning her as a quasi-redeemer alongside Christ.

**Contemporary Sophianism’s Distinction and Understanding of Sophia**

In contrast, Contemporary Sophianism takes a different approach, affirming Sophia as a **created spirit** who serves as a unique channel of divine wisdom without sharing in the divine essence. Rather than viewing Sophia as a fourth member of the Trinity, Contemporary Sophianism recognizes her as an exalted yet distinct being who reflects God’s wisdom without participating in His uncreated nature.

For us, Sophia functions as an “**unspotted mirror**,” to borrow the phrase from the Wisdom of Solomon 7:26, where it says that wisdom is *“the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.”* This metaphor captures Sophia’s role as a created being who perfectly reflects God’s wisdom without originating or embodying it herself. She is illuminated by God’s truth, much like the moon reflects the light of the sun, but she is not the source of that light.

In Contemporary Sophianism, Sophia is valued as a **wise guide and protector**, leading us toward choices that align with God’s truth and saving us from the consequences of destructive paths. However, her influence is distinct from the salvific power of Christ. Sophia “saves” in a practical sense, helping us navigate life’s decisions, but she does not redeem souls or restore our relationship with God. Redemption is the exclusive work of Christ, who alone bridges the gap between humanity and God.

By upholding Sophia as a created being, we maintain the **divine distinction** that ensures theological clarity. Sophia is not an inherent part of God’s essence but rather a spirit created to reflect and embody wisdom for creation. Her role, therefore, is complementary to Christ’s, not competitive. She illuminates the path of daily life, guiding us to God’s truth, while Christ offers the salvation that brings us fully back to God.

Through this distinction, Contemporary Sophianism honours Sophia’s purpose without conflating her with the Trinity. Sophia’s wisdom enriches our lives, helping us make choices that align with divine truth, but her influence remains rooted in creation. This approach allows us to celebrate the beauty and power of Sophia’s guidance without risking theological confusion or diluting the unique and unapproachable essence of the Trinity.

# 3. The Practical Role of Sophia in Contemporary Sophianism

One of the key distinctions between Russian Sophiology and Contemporary Sophianism lies in how each tradition views the role of Sophia in our lives. Russian Sophiology often treats Sophia as a vast, mystical principle—something woven into the very structure of the universe, embodying divine wisdom as a cosmic force. This approach, while philosophically and mystically rich, can become highly abstract. Sophia is viewed as an ethereal, almost impersonal force that bridges the divine and the created realms, yet she often feels remote, reserved for contemplation rather than daily interaction.

In Contemporary Sophianism, we recognize Sophia’s mystical beauty and cosmic depth, but we also bring her role down to earth, seeing her as a source of **practical guidance** and **everyday wisdom**. Rather than viewing her as an abstract principle, we see Sophia as a wise companion who walks with us through life, helping us navigate real challenges, make sound decisions, and align ourselves with God’s truth. In this way, Sophia’s role is both spiritual and grounded; she serves as a bridge between the divine and the created, but in a way that is accessible, immediate, and deeply relevant to daily life.

Our approach allows Sophia to retain her **mythical essence** without losing her practical value. Just as the moon reflects the light of the sun, Sophia reflects God’s wisdom, illuminating our path with a light that is both mystical and practical. She is a guide, a protector, and a presence that saves us from paths of confusion, impulsiveness, or despair, but she does so in ways that we can truly experience and apply.

**Sophia as Practical Wisdom in Action**

This practical approach is essential in Contemporary Sophianism, as we believe that divine wisdom should not only be admired but lived. Proverbs 3:21-23 speaks to this active, guiding role of wisdom: 

>*“My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.”* (KJV) 

Here, wisdom is not merely a concept but a safeguard, a way to keep our steps aligned with God’s path. In our tradition, Sophia embodies this wisdom, guiding us toward choices that are not just morally good but life-giving and purposeful.

Where Russian Sophiology might invite contemplation of Sophia as a cosmic mediator, Contemporary Sophianism invites believers to **engage with Sophia in daily decisions**. She is not distant or detached; she is near, offering insights that protect us from harm, remind us of our higher purpose, and keep us grounded in divine truth. Her presence saves us from a life without direction, not by overpowering us but by gently guiding us toward God’s will.

**Embracing the Mythical While Grounding the Practical**

While Contemporary Sophianism roots Sophia’s role in real life, this grounding does not strip her of her mystical beauty. Sophia’s presence is still deeply sacred, and she remains a figure of wonder and reverence. But her mystery becomes accessible, something we can encounter daily rather than only in rare moments of transcendence. By drawing Sophia closer to our everyday experiences, Contemporary Sophianism allows believers to live in communion with divine wisdom, making each day a journey where God’s guidance is felt in real, tangible ways.

In this way, Contemporary Sophianism balances the **mythical** with the **practical**, inviting believers to see Sophia as a constant companion rather than a distant cosmic force. Her wisdom is not just for contemplation but for action, helping us live lives that reflect God’s truth and purpose. This approach respects Sophia’s created nature and her role as a reflection of divine wisdom, keeping her grounded in our lived reality while preserving her status as a revered, exalted guide.

This integration of Sophia’s mythical depth with her practical influence sets Contemporary Sophianism apart, providing a path where wisdom is both mystical and deeply real, guiding each believer’s steps with a light that is both ancient and immediate.

# 4. Scriptural Foundations for Sophia’s Role in Contemporary Sophianism

Scripture offers a wealth of insight into Sophia’s nature and purpose, and in Contemporary Sophianism, we turn to these verses to understand her as a created being—a wise, guiding presence rather than a divine entity within the Godhead. Key passages from Proverbs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) depict Sophia as a unique manifestation of divine wisdom, yet clearly positioned as a created reflection, not as an uncreated part of God’s own nature. By examining these texts, we see a portrayal of Sophia that aligns with our understanding in Contemporary Sophianism and contrasts sharply with the mystical, quasi-divine interpretation of Russian Sophiology.

**Proverbs: Sophia as a Created Presence Who Guides and Protects**

Proverbs is rich with imagery of Sophia as a wise guide who actively protects and directs those who seek her. In Proverbs 8:22-31, we find one of the clearest descriptions of Sophia’s created status. Here, she speaks of herself, saying:

>*“The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water… Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.”* (Proverbs 8:22-24, 30-31 KJV)

This passage situates Sophia at the beginning of creation, a presence brought forth by God to participate in His work but distinct from His uncreated nature. Contemporary Sophianism holds that this language confirms Sophia as a created being—she is not eternal in the same way God is eternal. Instead, she was “set up” as the unspotted mirror of divine wisdom, present to guide creation without being part of the Godhead.

Russian Sophiology, however, often interprets this passage in a mystical sense, suggesting that Sophia’s presence “from the beginning” implies an inherent divinity. Some Russian Sophiologists see this as evidence that Sophia shares in God’s essence, an almost divine principle or mediator between God and the created world. In Contemporary Sophianism, we read this passage as affirming Sophia’s **created role as a companion to creation**, brought forth to illuminate God’s works without conflating her with God’s own nature.

**Wisdom of Solomon: Sophia as the Mirror, Not the Source**

The book of Wisdom offers further clarity on Sophia’s role as a created spirit, describing her as both exalted and distinctly separate from the divine essence. In Wisdom of Solomon 7:25-26, we read:

>*“For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty…For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.”* (Wisdom of Solomon 7:25-26 KJV)

This passage emphasizes that Sophia’s brilliance and wisdom are reflections of God’s glory, not self-originated. She is described as “the unspotted mirror,” a phrase that speaks to her role as a clear, undistorted reflection of divine wisdom. In Contemporary Sophianism, we interpret this as a profound yet clear indication that Sophia is a created spirit who reflects God’s attributes rather than originating them.

Russian Sophiology often interprets this imagery as Sophia possessing an intrinsic divine essence, arguing that terms like “breath of the power of God” suggest a close, quasi-divine relationship. They view her as a mystical “bridge” who participates in God’s glory. Contemporary Sophianism, however, honours the imagery of Sophia as a **mirror**—a created entity who refracts God’s light without containing it. This view maintains the distinction between Creator and creation, upholding Sophia as a beloved yet separate being who brings wisdom without encroaching on God’s unapproachable nature.

**Ecclesiasticus (Sirach): Sophia as a Created, Exalted Servant**

Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) also reinforces the view of Sophia as a created presence with a guiding, life-giving role. In Ecclesiasticus 1:4, we read:

>*“Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.”* (Ecclesiasticus 1:4 KJV)

This verse emphasizes Sophia’s role as the first among creation, a being whose wisdom and understanding precede all other created things but remain distinctly within creation. This understanding aligns with the Contemporary Sophianic view, where Sophia’s position as “first” does not imply divinity but rather an honoured place in God’s order.

In contrast, Russian Sophiology often reads this passage as evidence of Sophia’s divine quality, interpreting “created before all things” to suggest that she holds a foundational, near-cosmic status that transcends creation itself. In Contemporary Sophianism, we hold that this reading risks losing the clear boundary between God and His creation. Sophia’s early placement in creation reflects her importance as a guide and teacher, not an indicator of divine nature.

**The Path of Wisdom: Sophia’s Guidance as a Practical and Present Help**

Finally, passages throughout Proverbs highlight the practical, life-saving guidance Sophia offers. Proverbs 2:10-12 illustrates this beautifully:

>*“When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things.”* (Proverbs 2:10-12 KJV)

This scripture portrays Sophia’s role as an active, protective presence, one who “watches over” and “guards” those who seek her. In Contemporary Sophianism, this passage captures the essence of Sophia’s “saving” work: she is not a redeemer of souls but a practical protector, guiding us toward choices that keep us aligned with God’s truth and shielded from harm. Her role is immediate, present, and deeply grounded in daily life.

Russian Sophiology tends to interpret such passages as symbolic rather than immediate, focusing on Sophia’s presence as a cosmic principle rather than a close, accessible guide. Contemporary Sophianism brings this guidance closer, inviting believers to see Sophia as an active companion who offers wisdom in practical ways, helping them live lives of purpose, integrity, and alignment with God’s will.

# 5. Sophia’s Role in Salvation: Contrasting Russian Sophiology with Contemporary Sophianism

In Russian Sophiology, theologians like Vladimir Solovyov and Sergei Bulgakov present Sophia as a highly elevated figure whose role in salvation is almost cosmic in scope. They interpret Sophia as not merely a created entity but as a **mystical presence or principle** that bridges the uncreated, divine realm and the created world. In their view, Sophia’s purpose isn’t limited to guiding or imparting wisdom; rather, she acts as an intermediary, a mediator who participates in the process of uniting creation with God.

For Russian Sophiologists, Sophia is sometimes seen as a *cosmic redeemer*, working alongside Christ in a way that could even appear to supplement His salvific role. Sophia’s wisdom is believed to infuse creation with divine presence, gradually drawing all things back to God. This portrayal implies that Sophia, while not replacing Christ, has a *salvific function* in her own right—a quasi-divine role in sanctifying creation. In this sense, Sophia is seen as essential to the spiritual restoration of the universe, harmonizing and uniting all things in God.

In Russian Sophiology, Sophia’s “salvation” often reflects the concept of **universal reconciliation** (*apokatastasis*)—the eventual, mystical reunion of all things with the divine. Sophia acts as a bridge or mediator in this cosmic restoration, often depicted as leading creation toward God, perhaps even participating in the healing of humanity and the cosmos. This perspective views Sophia as an active, quasi-divine participant in salvation, not only guiding humanity but also working within creation itself to facilitate its transformation and ultimate return to God.

**The Scriptural Basis of Sophia’s Role in Contemporary Sophianism**

Contemporary Sophianism takes a different approach, drawing from scripture to affirm that Sophia’s role, while powerful and essential, remains distinct from Christ’s salvific work. In our view, Sophia is a created spirit of wisdom who offers guidance and protection, helping us navigate life and make choices aligned with God’s will. Her “saving” is not cosmic or redemptive but rooted in the way her wisdom saves us from poor decisions, misguided paths, and purposelessness. The unique work of soul redemption remains solely with Christ. In this way, we honour Sophia’s role as a wise, protective presence without conferring on her any redemptive or salvific power.

Proverbs 8:22-31, which we examined earlier, places Sophia firmly within creation, describing her as *“set up from everlasting, from the beginning”* (Proverbs 8:23 KJV). This language affirms that Sophia, while present from the start of creation, is brought forth by God as a companion to His works, not as an equal or uncreated being. Russian Sophiology’s interpretation, by suggesting that Sophia participates in the very essence of God, risks diminishing this essential distinction.

In the book of Wisdom, we read of Sophia as an “unspotted mirror,” a metaphor that highlights her role as a reflection rather than a source of divine power:

>*“For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.”* (Wisdom of Solomon 7:26 KJV)

This passage, which describes Sophia’s relationship to God as one of reflection, serves as the foundation for our understanding in Contemporary Sophianism. Sophia’s wisdom and guidance shine with God’s light, but she does not contain or originate that light. Her influence “saves” us in a practical sense, guiding us and keeping us from harm, but her role remains distinct from the eternal salvation that only Christ provides.

**The Unique Role of Christ in Salvation**

Throughout the New Testament, Christ is consistently presented as the sole mediator and redeemer of humanity. In 1 Timothy 2:5, Paul writes:

>*“For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”* (1 Timothy 2:5 KJV)

This passage highlights the exclusivity of Christ’s role as mediator, the one who alone bridges humanity and God. In Contemporary Sophianism, we uphold this central Christian belief by recognizing that Christ’s salvation—His redemptive work on the cross—is unparalleled. Sophia’s wisdom does not redeem souls or restore humanity to God; instead, it guides us toward a life aligned with divine truth, helping us to live in a way that is receptive to Christ’s saving grace.

Russian Sophiology, by assigning Sophia a cosmic mediating role, potentially conflates her guidance with Christ’s redemptive work, blurring the lines between wisdom’s practical influence and the unique, salvific power of Christ. Contemporary Sophianism maintains a clear distinction, affirming that Sophia points to divine truth but does not participate in the act of redemption.

**Wisdom’s Guidance as Practical Protection**

The book of Proverbs offers numerous passages that emphasize Sophia’s practical, protective role. In Proverbs 3:5-6, we read:

>*“Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”* (Proverbs 3:5-6 KJV)

While Sophia’s guidance is invaluable, leading us on “straight paths,” these verses reinforce that our ultimate trust should rest in God, whose divine plan encompasses and transcends the wisdom that Sophia reflects. Sophia’s wisdom aligns us with God’s truth, saving us from error and harm in our daily lives, but it is not itself a source of salvation.

Proverbs 2:10-12 expands on this, describing wisdom’s ability to “watch over” and “deliver” those who seek it:

>*“When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things.”* (Proverbs 2:10-12 KJV)

In Contemporary Sophianism, this passage captures the essence of Sophia’s role. She “saves” us in a practical, immediate sense—delivering us from harmful paths, offering discretion and understanding that protect us from poor choices and consequences. However, this form of saving is not redemptive; it is a daily, practical grace that keeps us aligned with God’s will without stepping into the realm of spiritual salvation.

# 6. Sophia’s Distinct Role in Contemporary Sophianism

In Contemporary Sophianism, Sophia holds a unique and cherished role as the spirit of divine wisdom, guiding practitioners in their daily lives with insight, clarity, and protection. While her presence carries a mystical beauty, Sophia’s work is practical and immediately accessible, helping us to live lives of integrity, purpose, and alignment with God’s will. She serves as a wise companion who offers direction and discernment, yet her influence remains grounded, reflecting divine truth without presuming to embody it.

Sophia’s role within Contemporary Sophianism is that of a **spiritual guide and guardian**, one who illuminates our paths and “saves” us from paths of confusion, impulsivity, and purposelessness. Her presence brings divine wisdom close, offering practitioners not only the comfort of guidance but also the empowerment to make choices that reflect God’s truth.

**Sophia as a Companion in Daily Life**

Unlike the abstract or cosmic Sophia presented in Russian Sophiology, Contemporary Sophianism views Sophia as an intimate companion, present in the daily lives of believers. She is not a distant force or an untouchable concept; rather, she is a spiritual presence who walks alongside us, providing guidance that is both immediate and deeply relevant. In Proverbs 4:6-7, we find a reflection of this relationship:

>*“Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”* (Proverbs 4:6-7 KJV)

Here, Sophia’s wisdom is portrayed as both protective and essential, a presence that watches over those who seek her. In Contemporary Sophianism, practitioners are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with Sophia, inviting her wisdom into each decision, large or small. Through this relationship, Sophia’s guidance becomes a living, practical influence, keeping believers aligned with divine truth and helping them to embody God’s wisdom in every aspect of life.

**Sophia’s Protective Role: A “Saving” Influence in Practical Life**

Sophia’s guidance offers a unique form of protection, often described as a “saving” influence that steers us away from choices that could lead to harm or spiritual stagnation. While Sophia does not redeem souls, she acts as a kind of guardian over the lives of believers, helping them navigate life’s complexities with insight and clarity. In Proverbs 2:10-12, we read:

>*“When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: To deliver thee from the way of the evil man.”* (Proverbs 2:10-12 KJV)

Sophia’s wisdom “enters the heart” and “watches over” those who embrace her guidance, a dynamic that Contemporary Sophianism sees as Sophia’s distinctive form of saving. This is not salvation in the eternal sense, as only Christ can redeem and restore us to God, but it is a form of practical salvation that shields practitioners from misguided decisions and their consequences. Sophia’s protection is like a spiritual safeguard, preserving believers from paths that lead to emptiness, distraction, or moral compromise.

**A Mirror Reflecting God’s Wisdom, Not the Source**

One of the central principles in Contemporary Sophianism is that Sophia is a reflection of God’s wisdom rather than its origin. As described in Wisdom of Solomon 7:26, Sophia is the “unspotted mirror of the power of God,” a pure reflection of divine light. This imagery is foundational to our understanding of her role; Sophia’s wisdom shines with God’s truth, but it is not self-originating. She serves as a conduit, a created being who transmits divine wisdom without holding it inherently.

This metaphor of the mirror also distinguishes Sophia’s influence from that of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, as part of the Trinity, shares in God’s uncreated nature and acts with God’s full authority in the world. Sophia, on the other hand, is an exalted creation whose wisdom comes from reflecting the light of God. Her role, therefore, is to illuminate rather than embody, to guide rather than sanctify. This distinction is fundamental in Contemporary Sophianism, ensuring that practitioners understand Sophia’s wisdom as a sacred gift rather than a source of divine power.

**Sophia’s Wisdom as a Path Toward Fulfillment**

Following Sophia’s guidance leads believers toward a life that reflects God’s goodness, wisdom, and purpose. In Contemporary Sophianism, practitioners see Sophia’s wisdom as a path of alignment—a way of living that brings inner fulfillment and harmony with God’s will. Proverbs 3:13-18 beautifully captures the richness of this path:

>*“Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.”* (Proverbs 3:13-17 KJV)

Sophia’s wisdom leads to “pleasant ways” and “paths of peace,” showing that her influence is not only protective but also transformative. For practitioners of Contemporary Sophianism, Sophia’s role is to help them live a life that reflects divine truth in practical, tangible ways, bringing spiritual depth and meaning to each moment. Through her guidance, believers find a life of peace, purpose, and integrity, rooted in wisdom that connects them to God’s will without conflating Sophia’s guidance with divine authority.

**A Unique Role Within the Lives of Practitioners**

In Contemporary Sophianism, Sophia is neither a distant, impersonal force nor a divine being. She is a cherished companion whose wisdom and protection are real, immediate, and personal. Her influence does not replace Christ’s redemptive role, nor does it diminish the Holy Spirit’s active presence in the world. Instead, Sophia’s guidance serves as a distinct and complementary presence in the lives of practitioners, offering a light that helps them walk faithfully in God’s path.

By following Sophia, practitioners of Contemporary Sophianism experience a form of “saving” that keeps them grounded, protected, and aligned with divine wisdom. It is a salvation of daily life, a protection that preserves their integrity, clarity, and purpose. This distinct role honours Sophia’s unique, created nature, allowing believers to embrace her guidance fully while upholding the divine distinction that preserves the integrity of God’s uncreated essence.

# 7. Conclusion: Harmonizing Sophia’s Guidance with Christ’s Redemption

In Contemporary Sophianism, Sophia and Christ are understood as fulfilling distinct but complementary roles. Christ’s redemptive work—His life, death, and resurrection—offers humanity the unique gift of salvation, restoring us to God and securing our souls for eternity. Sophia’s guidance, on the other hand, brings divine wisdom into the immediate, practical realm of daily life, helping us walk paths that reflect God’s truth, integrity, and purpose.

While Russian Sophiology often elevates Sophia’s role, positioning her as a quasi-divine figure participating in cosmic salvation, Contemporary Sophianism maintains a **clear distinction** between her created wisdom and Christ’s redemptive power. This distinction preserves the integrity of the Trinity and the exclusive role of Christ as our redeemer, while honouring Sophia as an exalted spirit whose guidance illuminates our lives without crossing into the realm of divine salvation.

**Christ’s Unique Role as the Redeemer**

Scripture speaks clearly about Christ’s unparalleled role in reconciling humanity with God. In John 14:6, Jesus declares, *“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”* (KJV) His role as redeemer is absolute and exclusive, and through His sacrificial love, He bridges the eternal divide that sin has created, offering us a path to salvation. No other being, created or uncreated, shares in this role; it is the unique work of Christ to restore us to God and bring us to eternal life.

In Contemporary Sophianism, we honour this distinction by understanding that while Sophia’s influence saves us in life by guiding us and keeping us from harm, she does not redeem us. Her wisdom helps us align with God’s will and walk paths of righteousness, but it does not restore our souls to God. Christ alone holds the power to redeem and renew, and Sophia’s guidance leads us toward Him, helping us live in a way that is receptive to His saving grace.

**Sophia’s Complementary Guidance**

In Proverbs 3:13-18, we read of the blessedness that comes from following wisdom:

>*“Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.”* (Proverbs 3:13-17 KJV)

These verses capture the essence of Sophia’s role within Contemporary Sophianism. Her wisdom brings peace, clarity, and purpose, leading us toward lives that reflect God’s goodness and truth. She offers a form of practical salvation by steering us away from paths of confusion, harm, and purposelessness. Yet this form of saving is distinct from the eternal salvation offered by Christ; it is a salvation of life and action, not of the soul.

By following Sophia, we walk paths that are “ways of pleasantness” and “paths of peace.” Her guidance keeps us spiritually attuned, helping us make choices that align with God’s will and deepening our relationship with Him. This alignment prepares our hearts to receive Christ’s grace, allowing us to live lives that are not only protected but also fully receptive to the redemptive love that only Christ can provide.

**A Life of Wisdom and Redemption**

Together, Sophia’s guidance and Christ’s redemption form a harmonious path in Contemporary Sophianism. Christ redeems our souls, restoring us to God and opening the door to eternal life. Sophia, as a created reflection of divine wisdom, guides us in the present, helping us make choices that honour God’s truth. Her influence saves us from the mistakes and pitfalls of life, protecting our hearts, but she does so as a servant and a reflection, not as a co-redeemer.

This harmonious relationship allows us to experience the fullness of divine wisdom and love. In each decision, we are invited to follow Sophia’s guidance, experiencing her protection and insight. And through Christ’s redemptive power, we are restored to God, experiencing the depth of His love and the promise of eternal life.

As we walk this path, we honour both Sophia’s guiding presence and Christ’s saving grace, experiencing a life that is both rooted in wisdom and redeemed by love. In Contemporary Sophianism, this harmonious relationship illuminates a way of life that is not only filled with purpose and clarity but ultimately leads us to God, who is the source of all wisdom and the giver of eternal life.

*May the light of Sophia’s wisdom guide you on paths of peace, clarity, and purpose. And may the redeeming love of Christ fill your heart with grace, restoring your soul to God. As you walk this life in wisdom and redemption, may you find strength, joy, and unending communion with the Divine, now and always.*

It makes me very sad and tormented. When they've neglected the main thing, which is making sure your heart is right before God. You have to ask God and seek Him to make your heart right with Him. I did this, I sought and talked about so many earthly and meaningless things during my lifetime, when my heart wasn't even right with God. Christianity is so simple, it is about submitting to God and truly repenting from the heart, and taking up your cross daily to do this more and more to grow in your walk with Christ. People make it so complicated and miss the point, and start to make it all about them and feeling like they're special. Trust me when you get to the brink of hell like me you won't be thinking about those things. You will be wishing you actually pleased God.

For me I was vain and prideful. I wanted my Christianity to be full of intellectual prowess and different sub-belief systems and theology. It was not based on a foundation of humble love for God and willingness to be taught by His wisdom. It is all useless. The Bible says that knowledge puffs up while loves edifies. And without love, we are nothing. That is why my entire faith was fake. I was making it all about knowledge of the right things to do and information about God, rather than love of God above myself from the heart. All that I knew about God was useless at the end of the day because deep inside, I hated Him because I loved myself too much. Be honest with yourself and whether you relate to your faith more like a Pharisee or a disciple. If your heart isn't right you need to get right now. Pray and fast fervently to God now because it will get harder as you sin more, and eventually it will be too late. Every time you sin your heart gets harder. Your heart will be hard and couldn't truly repent even if you wanted to. I didn't realize this until I reached that point. So don't wait. There's no more information you need to learn or therapy you need to get. That's a lie, the only thing you need is to take responsibility for your sin and crucify the flesh and pride.",2,True,,,1.0,False,

My family have always been hard to deal with, most of them spend their days not working, creating problems, abandoning their children etc I’ve always been different from them, I’ve struggled to understand their choices from an early age.  I almost didn’t survive an illness in 2007, when I woke up from my coma, I remember looking out of the window and I thanked God for saving my life🤷‍♀️, my first born was only 3 months old. I remember being shocked that I thanked someone I’ve never believed in, so I ignored it and got on with my life and raised my son. 2 more children followed and some hard times came with it. In 2016 I needed surgery again, in 2017 my husband and I split. We have remained friends luckily even when I found out my brother in law was grooming my daughter that same year.  I spent 4 yrs in crown court fighting to put him away, on my own, no other family member from both of my children’s sides came to any court dates but it worked, only after all that fighting, after staying strong for my children, fighting against not just the law but family too, and losing my father in this time, I broke, I completely broke, I went to my bed and didn’t get out of it  for over a year. When I came back, my house was destroyed, my children were feral and my finances were a joke. I’ve spent the last couple of years making amends for my failings and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  After all this I don’t understand why I keep thinking of God.

Why do I feel so drawn to him, now more than ever? I’m so confused. I’ve not been raised religious, I’ve not even been christened.

Some people I know argue that the creation stories in Genesis shouldn’t be taken literally—they see them as more about spiritual truths than scientific fact. Others suggest that God could have used evolution as part of the creation process, so science and faith don’t have to be at odds.

However, I also see a lot of folks who reject evolution entirely, feeling that accepting it somehow undermines their faith. This leads to some pretty heated discussions about what it means to believe in both the Bible and modern science.

So, how do you all reconcile these viewpoints? Is it really possible to believe in both evolution and Christianity, or does that compromise the Bible’s authority? Would love to hear your thoughts!",26,True,,,0.42,False,

Theme: Book of Jeremiah 

Scripture: Jeremiah 1; Jeremiah 2; Jeremiah 3; Jeremiah 1:5; Jeremiah 1:10 & 2 Thes.1:12

Message:

CHOSEN BEFORE CREATION

When we talk about the purpose of life, surprisingly, there are many people today who do not know the purpose or call in their lives. They are confused about their future. Indeed, in this world, no one knows what will happen, but we need to know that our life has a purpose. Jeremiah 1:5 NKJV says, ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you...""  Even though this verse was written for Jeremiah, it speaks to us the same way. God has known us long before we were formed, and no one knows us well except God.

God did not create us without a clear purpose. Several years ago, Rick Warren wrote the book, ""Purpose Driven Life"", which became a bestseller. This book tells us that our life should be directed by divine purpose, that is, the purpose of God who formed us. Our goal is to glorify God's Name through our lives (2 Thess. 1:12).  Let us know our calling and live our lives accordingly.

Each of us is created by God with a beautiful task and purpose to glorify God's Name.

Guys it was so weird but in my dream I was just shouting Praises to God and saying ""I rebuke you' and stuff like that and I was trying to get a hold of my rosary (cause in my dream I was in bed - idk if that makes sense). Finally they stopped and then I woke up. When I woke up I just got a hold of my rosary and as I woke up I was still saying Praises to God. Also when I woke up I felt soo sick. Like rlly sick. I ended up going back to bed but the whole thing was kinda weird. I'm not scared but idk I think its funny because Arnold and Trump were there.

I feel really lost in life. I was thinking about reverting back to christianity, because everyone I know who is like a devoted christian is really successful in life and know their worth,  always reach for greatness, and know who they are. So I don't know, thought I'd try it. But I can't get past the fact that the bible never really makes sense to me, and just the overall greed, negativity, and judgement of a lot of churches and christians really strays me away from doing it really. I don't wanna believe in something that I dont truly believe in, but I really feel like if I can give all my problems metaphorically into something I can trusts hands, and connect spiritually I feel like my life would change drastically and I wouldn't feel so lost and all alone in every problem I have all the time.

For some background, I was religious and grew up in the church. My mom was a semi strict christian, and our church was run by a family friend of ours that teached a really extreme way to teaching the word, and really descended into madness after he had a stroke. I won't get into it but i've also experienced a lot of religious trauma in that church, which ultimately strayed me away further. Any advice or other things I can try is always appreciated, because I just dont know what my purpose is anymore.

Paul also says:


“And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.”

If you just came to Christ and used to celebrate Halloween , on this Halloween, cry out to God to have mercy for all the abominations that happen on this day. child sacrifice. For those who are satanist & witches and don't know they are being deceived by the great deceiver.

I'm Simon and I'm 18 years old, first of all excuse my bad English, not my first language. So onto the topic, I need help, and easiest way would be to ask opinion on it of my fellow belivers. A bit of backstory to let you get my perspective, I'm born in Catholic family and there were ups and downs when it comes to my faith, but in the summer of 2023 I completly returned to Christ, and it startred around that moment. Around 2 months after finding Jesus I saw my first demon in my sleep, even tho it was a dream I felt fear that I have not in my entire life. I can't explain it porperly even if I wanted to. But what's shocking is that in every of my dream there is a common thing, I fend of evil. Either saying words like ""Jesus is King"" or ""I command you in the name of Christ"", yes it sounds a bit cliché. And everytime it's hard to say these words in different situations, for example in my first time I couldn't muster a word until the almost end. And when I finally said that Jesus is my Saviour it just stopped, Demon dissapeared and I woke up. That was a reeocuring dream with this theme every few months, but every demon showed themselves in different apperance and with different things it tried to do. Today was no difference, expect it was scarier. In my dream I felt presence all along, after some time I took my cross that I have from comfirmation(which is always next to me when I sleep) and said words ""Show yourself evil"",  and went to my living room where I would find it. ALERT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WEAK TO  ANY TOPIC RELATED TO CHILDS.
It was like tornado flew trough it with everything on the ground, there I saw my mother(45) and sister(17) laying in from of my youngest sister(10) and crying, apperance of my youngest still is clear and visible to me. She was floating in upside down cros possition, blooded teeth with that Demonic look you could tell at one glance. In my dream I wasted no time, got down in front of her where Bible already was, took off the cross off my neck and with it in my hand I started repeating words ""Jesus is King"" bringing cross closer to her and closer with each word said. I knew I couldn't stop no matter what, it was getting worse to speak also I could tell Demon was getting more and more angrier as it tried to stop me by screaming or cursing at me. When the end aproached I almost couldn't speak I had like something wraping around my throath. But with last sentance and I quote ""Jesus Is King, return to where you belong demon, In The Name Of Christ I command you"", my sister fell to the ground, night turned into day and I woke up. It's currently 2:12 AM as I write. I know I wrote a long post but I beg of you for a help, it's serious matter, I can still feel the fear and emotions I got in my sleep.

Let me explain. My dad owns an industrial service business and he would annually take in 200k a year approximately, at the mid-2023 business started to go down, but it wasn’t until the start of this year that he was kicked out of the company he offered his services to, this was a massive hit, we couldn’t afford food, rent, school tuitions (I have 17/yo brother), etc. Shit really went down but not only that, 2 of my best friends betrayed me in the most hurtful way possible, which only made this situation worse for me, eventually my mom had to look for a job, and we had to sell one of our cars, that meant that there was no way for me to be able to go to my soccer trainings which was the only thing that kept me away from all this shit going on, so now I was at my house 24/7 except for when I was in school and my physique got worse, in July we had to move to my grandma’s because we couldn’t afford rent, my parents have become hostile at times at each other because my mom constantly blames my dad for being in this situation, even though his business is stabilizing now, though, I haven’t gone to school since May because of problems with my tuition, and we still live at my grandma’s, we’re about 50k in debt and I’ve had my heart broken 3 times, now, at the start of 2024 I prayed so many times for peace, happiness and love to come to my life, but life has been nothing but hell on earth, I really wish God listened to me, I pray, and pray and pray but I don’t think he listens to me because of my sins, I tend to think he really has abandoned me. I love God infinitely and I always will but I believe my sins block his sigh to my heart, I want to get close to him, but it never seems to work, I’ve tried so many times to read the Bible, have more deep conversations with him, thank him for everything, avoid sinning, honor him, but it never works out, life just get worse and more miserable. Whenever I get glimpses of positivity and hope of having a better life, it eventually dims for some reason and I can just feel the devastating, crushing wrath of God pounding me down each time, I don’t know why he does this, I don’t wanna feel his wrath, I want to feel his love, and I wanna make him proud.

Furthermore, if the bible were to say something along the lines of “Go my child, murder a random family, this will show your devotion to me” (obviously a very extreme example, but whatever), would you do so simply because that’s what the bible/your religion tells you is necessary?

I was the one at fault and i realized things too late.

I struggled with porn addiction and lust and i feel like that made me treat her worse. I would look at other women but i always had my self-conscience telling me i shouldn’t do that to her. I was praying everyday for God to help me fix myself and act right for her because i really loved that girl and i felt loved by her almost unconditionally. 

After the breakup i only had God and my mind was a frightening mess, i would talk to God all day long and i would beg him to give me another chance with her. I talked to her again and she told me that she doesn’t want to fix things that time has run out and i accepted things for what they were. It made me closer to God and i put my trust in him that he will lead me on the right track and i do not understand what is happening now but later i will and i know it will be good for me.

That seems plausible, but what about those sins where someone steals or destroys something that can never ever be restored again, for all eternity -  I'm talking about virginity.

 Think of all those young women and children raped and sold into sex slavery. Their precious innocence and virginities ""lost forever"".
While I've had Christians tell me many times that God indeed will resurrect the dead, or restore someone's leg that was amputated, or heal a body from horrific burn scars.....apparently God can not restore virginity. Once it's lost, it's lost for good, forever. And perhaps that's why there is so much significance in glorifying the Ever Virgin Mary, Mother of God and all the crowned virgin saints who were martyrd for keeping their purity. It appears that this virginity on earth is something that will extend into the eternal and be remembered forever.......

So that brings me back to the  victims of rape who lost their virginities in such a horrific way, that memory and reality too will extend into the memory eternal - God will not restore their virginities or undo the trauma that happened to them. So why should the unrepentant rapists in this case, eventually be freed from hell and acquire salvation? They have stolen such a precious thing from someone else, which runs deep into the psychology and emotions of that person, and they will never get their virginity and purity back.

Basically, the idea of my question is, why are other belief systems looked so down upon by Christians? It seems like our beliefs need to be attacked for some reason.

In my personal life, I have felt that the language Christians use is very offensive to other beliefs! Some Christians are even so consumed by if other people are a part of their religion or not. I don't think we have to be to be treated fairly for our own beliefs! I always want to communicate to them that it is offensive, but it seems that they already don't see me as righteous as them. As well as the fact that I respect others and their faith, why can't mine be respected? 

I respect and accept other religions that I am not a part of, especially Christianity since it is such a sensitive topic for most people, including Christians. But I still will have Christians telling me how my patron deity is the embodiment of evil and how I will go to Hell for holding different beliefs and being on a completely different path. I don't believe this way, since I am not a part of this religion and I don't hold those beliefs.

I'm trying to be as respectful as possible, but if anyone could help me better understand how people enforcing their personal spiritual beliefs onto others is ok, I would greatly appreciate it!

I have sincerely tried to be a Christian, and what I've learned is that being a Christian is HARD; it can feel like living in a prison, being in a body with a forfeit soul, searching for every possible way out in order to feel the hope that radiates from the heart of the religion and realize the life promised in the Bible. 

That is to say, I have a deep respect for Christians who keep the faith through thick and thin, and I am astounded by the sheer number of people who seem to find God's love.

Honestly the goodness of God was too great, as I write this down I was going to write with a sorrowful heart, but than as I was going to write, the Holy Ghost reminded me of scripture as I was thinking,, “hey you know if I can write something good that God did for me, than my day isn’t that bad. Than spoke the Holy Ghost.
“count all suffering with joy, for we know it will all be used for good”
And I got overwhelmed with the goodness of the Lord, that I was like there’s nothing that I can complain about.
Good woke me up, got to talk with my wife, got to forgive, even though we fought, we made up, kissed each other, and she went to sleep with a smile on her face, got to make my dad happy, etc etc etc, the list goes on. The goodness of the Lord is/should be our joy. Ay I can’t complain all that much, I may of not noticed it throughout my day, my testimony of being able to be alive today, and talk walk spread the goodness of the Lord etc is a testament to God answering just one prayer, and that’s to let me see the sunrise

i'm going through a stage of religious and spiritual reawakening ever since 2018. i think i always believed in a creator, even when i still lied to myself about my atheistic/nihilistic beliefs i thought i was in a show or movie being watched by an audience that i simply can't see. either the occasional unexplainable things in my life have degraded any sanity that i had or i was simply never sane to begin with, and this only got worse when paranormal things started happening to me. i can list off a few delusions i had. i keep on having this fear that i'm a prophet because of the things i've seen, like a prophet who denies himself as one but is actually chosen by God to reveal something to the faithful. i have heard voices, they're not always consistent but they happen to me, most commonly whenever i think of this illness i have, yes i hear voices when i think that i hear voices. other times i hear voices when i'm near a running fan or theres music in another room. but theres been weird instances where i hear multiple voices that felt real, like they weren't in my head but one ear could hear the voices but the other not so much. i remember when i really old telling my mom that i was running through a forest near where we lived before we were even born, just out of the blue to her. and finally, i legitimately thought i was a zombie. it was full blown delusion which traumatized me to my core. i thought that i was infected, killed and ate my entire family, and that every time i ate it was actually the flesh of one of my family members or of someone who went into the house. and that what i was actually seeing, my parents and stuff, were just hallucinations. thats all of them that i feel comfortable talking about, i'm sorry if any of this disturbed you and i pray that no demonic forces lingered in these words i made.

its honestly a terrifying reality i find myself in right now, i still believe in the good God of peace, but i'm delusional and inherently not right in the head. i can't ask this to anyone in my family because they're secular and i know the answer they'd give me. i can't ask this to people at my church too, not even the pastor, he preaches not help people. and i can assure you that i have had voices which pretended to be God's. i'm sure that he has talked to me so many times only for me to reject him out fear because i can't divide the voices in my head from his, i literally don't know his voice, what it sounds like how he talks. this is the tip of the iceberg and they're are many other thoughts, dreams, and visions that i've had which are so heretical that i'm truly scared about the safety of my faith. i'm really worried that these delusion are leading me from God and into hell, and i don't know anyone to turn to. this is the only life i have on earth, and because of bad luck i'll have to suffer and cope with mental illness for the rest of my life, but i am also desperate to seek divination and oneness with the almighty, but i don't know how when my mind can't make up real from fake.

thats all i'm gonna write down. if there are any services where i can be told how know whats my delusions and whats God's attempts of communing with me then please tell me because i can't take this illness anymore. ",10,True,Crossposted,xpostd,0.67,False,Crossposted

I’ve had chronic loneliness for basically all my life so far. I’ve been depressed and I’ve been craving human connection for years. Even in elementary I had no friends. For my highschool prom, we had to book our seats (so people can sit with their friends or partner), and no one cared to ask me if I wanted to sit with them so the school put me with randoms prob because they felt bad. Even the people I thought I was making a connection with, in the end, didn’t want to even take a graduation photo with me. 

Fast forward to this morning, there was some girl online and she said things to me that I haven’t heard anyone say to me before. It made me want to cry. Then the conversation went downhill and it just turned into sexting. I feel horrible. I’ve been feeling like I had no purpose other than working. So when I read those words of appreciation then I got carried away. I hate myself. I always have. So I just wanted someone to tell me things to make me feel like I have worth. I wanted to feel wanted. I have no close friends and I have no one who truly appreciated me outside of my mom and sister. I don’t know what it’s like to have a deep connection. I just wanted to feel something, man. But I feel horrible now. I feel like such a disappointment. I feel like I might be the loneliest man in my family. At 18 and it’s already this bad. I haven’t had any deep connections so making new ones irl feels almost impossible. And when I resort to this to feel something, I feel worse

So the dream starts with me and my family, we were going on a road trip to somewhere. My dad was driving, mom in the passenger and me and brother in the back. All was well until my dad accidentally drove too fast on a road with a steep drop, we started flying and were in the air for a good 10 seconds. While we were in the air we all kind of accepted our fate, we all said that we loved each other. I remember closing my eyes and squeezing them as tight as possible bracing for impact. But after 5 or so seconds I didn’t feel anything. I look up and we were driving along a dirt path in a beautiful nature scene. Everything outside of the car was so blisteringly bright but at the same time so beautiful, the light rays and the grass flowing. My whole family was still there, we were all confused but we eventually figured out that we might’ve just died because we all remember falling and saying love u and all of that. So we just talked about life and other things for maybe 10 minutes still just cruising along this path. When suddenly papers appeared in front of us. The papers contained what looks like a tour guide of where we would end up going. On my paper the words were a deep red while my mom’s was a bright and beautiful blue. So I took this as meaning I was going to hell, just seeing the red on my paper was enough to scare me so much that I instantly woke up. And that’s pretty much it, is this a sign from God to get my life together or I’m going to hell, or could this just be a random dream?

Like my brain just threatens me to do stuff and if I don't want to it be sayin that if I don't I don't love GOD and He will punish me n that I'm unforgiven. 


I used to go to therapy but I didnt know if a religious problem is important and if my therapist was even religious, so I stopped going and tried to figure it out myself, which has obviously been breaking me more to where I wanna kill myself and give up on being Christian. 


Going on is really my last hope, my family members tell me to pray but its one of my problems and I just don't know what to do and if I'm doing the right thing anymore. 
I was raised Catholic, but was never really conscious about the world and life and death til last year and now. I felt horrible digging into the world where people destroy, it made me afraid of this world and I felt sick. I started to question His existence and just one opinion of someone saying He’s not real immediately broke down my faith and my mentality too lol, it’s embarrassing but it’s true.

My mom recently became a follower of Christ as she got hit by a car and locked up in jail.
My dad passed when I was 4, getting my mom into drugs and getting locked up n getting out then doing the same bad thing. She got locked up recently and I wasnt surprised but I hated her for it. I don't know how but it made me change mentally and I had bitter feelings toward her and got more depressed and had anxiety attacks. I got to talk to her some times, and she told me in one of the calls that she turned to GOD. She told me while she was doing drugs and on her bike she got hit by a truck and surprisingly survived, they took her to the hospital but she didn't want to stay long so she wouldn't get caught by the police so she took her IVs off and she was hurt and bleeding but she still ran till she got caught eventually. She told me on the call that GOD gave her one last chance to quit doing drugs n smoking, and to finally do her job as a mother; as I was raised by my grandma at 4 to now. So I'm glad she's still alive, thank GOD.

Proverbs 3:6 

6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.

Proverbs 11:30

30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise.

Daniel 12:3

3 And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.

Matthew 5:14-16

1gff5ir,"I desperately want to believe in God, but I don’t know what my next step is",somerandomreference,2024-10-30 05:10:25+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gff5ir/i_desperately_want_to_believe_in_god_but_i_dont/,1,/r/Christianity/comments/1gff5ir/i_desperately_want_to_believe_in_god_but_i_dont/,Christianity,"Hi everyone, I’m not really sure how to start this, so I’ll do my best to provide some context. If you take the time to read this and provide advice, I would be so immensely grateful. 
(Also, I currently don’t believe in God, but I tried to type this out as respectfully as I know how to. If I framed any of this in a disrespectful light, please know that was not my intention)

I grew up in the Catholic faith and remained Catholic until I hit adulthood. Within my Catholic teachings within my experience, I didn’t get to ask a lot of questions, and when I did, it was met with “why are you questioning God” and “have faith.” I wasn’t even taught about any other religions; Catholicism was all I knew. 

When I got to adulthood, I was riddled with scorn and disdain for God. I was so angry at the God that I had been taught about. I entirely took myself out of Catholicism, but was desperate to learn about other religions and peoples’ spirituality. Although I didn’t realize I was doing this, I actively tried to shake the foundations of those who loved God. I would ask them questions that I had, and they rarely had answers for me; this was very fulfilling for me, in a way, because it made me feel like I made the right choice to step away from God. It made the resentment “easier” because I just thought “oh, all of these people have no idea what they’re talking about, so I guess it’s all bs after all.” 

When I moved out of my home when I was 19, I met someone I connected with immediately. Imagine my surprise when she told me she was a Christian. Naturally, I shook at her foundation only to have mine come crumbling down. For the first time ever, I had someone in my life who had answers for the questions I had. At first, it started with belligerence, and very quickly shifted into a respectful conversation with genuine curiosity on both sides. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve said “I get it, but I don’t like it.” The way we describe these conversations now is “iron sharpening iron.” 

She’s been with me and talked with me through my entire journey and exploration with spirituality, and never once have I felt like she was “trying to get me to come to the faith” or “preaching at me” which is crucial for me as someone who was preached at constantly, and it pushed me further away from the idea of God. 

I’ve explored a lot. Atheism, nihilism (one of the hardest times in my life when I had the nihilist world view), just believing in the universe; you name it. What people don’t tell you about nihilism that there is a very fine line between “nothing matters” and “everything matters.” There’s no such thing as a coincidence in my book. That leads me into the part of my spiritual journey that resonated with me the most: just being in tune with the universe. In case you’re looking for defining terms, I use the word “universe” to describe an all-knowing, all-loving entity that is, and has been, everywhere, always. Or at least that’s the best way I can describe it at the moment. 

Fast forward 4 years, this woman is still my best friend and single-handedly shifted my entire perspective on God. This is closest I’ve ever been to believing in God, but I feel stuck, like I’ve hit a glass ceiling. There are things that still don’t make sense to me. I still find myself saying “I get it, but I don’t like it.” 

I know Jesus existed, I just don’t know if He’s God. And I struggle because I know that He was prophesied so many times before He was born. I know there’s so much evidence to point to Him being God, but I don’t feel convicted. My friend even suggested I ask God to reveal Himself to me. I asked Him for a code. Because it’s so private to me, I won’t share it here, but just know that you wouldn’t just see it in your everyday life. In fact, the people I’ve told have never seen the thing I asked God to show me. And 5 times, I was shown that code. But I didn’t feel any different, and I have no idea why. I don’t know why I don’t feel compelled or convicted to worship Jesus. 
 
I think I’m scared. Actually, I know I am. I’m so scared of losing my myself. I’m so scared of living a life that could potentially be a lie. I’m so scared of losing friends. I’m scared of not being able to articulate why I believe in God and why other people should to. I’m scared to meet someone who’s been hurt like I was 4 years ago before I found my friend. I’m scared that if I come to the faith that I won’t be able to to guide the people I love to Jesus and then not see them in heaven. I’m scared that my lgbtq+ friends won’t feel safe with me. I’m scared that if I put my faith in God that I’ll lose everything that’s ever been important to me. And I know how that sounds too, because life should be centered around God, not earthly things, but that’s a very difficult thing for me to grapple with. And I feel immense guilt at the idea that I could be a terrible Christian while also knowing that God would still love me when I’m not at my best. I know all of that about God, but I still don’t know. I know it sounds silly, and I know that I got signs, but I just don’t know what I need to do to believe Jesus is actually God. 

All that to say, this is my experience. If you read all of this, thank you. I’m not sure if anyone else has felt this way or has any advice, but if you do, please, I’m listening. And please, if you have questions, I welcome all of them. ",3,True,Support,support,1.0,False,Support

I never called, I always just believed what I was told by staff and felt it wasn’t my place until today. Today I called a family that had left a few weeks ago, I wasn’t very close with this family so I was really unsure if they’d even talk to me. Turns out I was the first to call….no one called them….zero people. This family had spent years at our church pouring their time, sweat, love and finances into this church. When they left….no one called. That hurt them even more. I don’t agree with a lot of reasons they left but it doesn’t matter, I love this family and the last thing I want is for them to think they aren’t missed.

After that call, I had the courage to call a few other families…same story.

When I was 14 years old I met a guy who was 18 (even if it was a kinda short age gap it still manage to effect me significantly) it was a 4 year on and off relationship I didn’t end until I became 18 years old (I am now 20.) Even if we were both considered teenagers I was so innocent at 14 I was still playing with Barbies and watching My little Pony and the first day he met me he asked me what my body count was ( I didn’t even know what that was at the time) he knew so much I didn’t know he exposed me to so much more and it caused to over sexualize my self for him I didn’t know any better but I feel so guilty for letting everything he’s done happen to me 4 years of him coming in and out of my life trying to have sex with me and I never let him until we reunited when I was 18 and we finally did it and he ghosted me after that . After our last encounter I found myself spiraling I was extremely hyper sexual meeting up with random guys to cope . Two years later I’m so ashamed of myself I feel like my innocents was taken from me he turned me into someone I wasn’t and I let all this sexual energy eat me alive and take over . Before him I was known to be pure and innocent that is what I was know for I want that back I want that part of me back so bad I wish I was a virgin again I feel so guilty when I’m in a new relationship that I’m not pure anymore . I feel like new men can’t look at me without gazing over me sexually. 

The past two years I’ve done a pretty good job at forgiving what had happened and let it go the best I can I blocked all accounts and numbers , until i recently found out he is back in town and I’m pretty sure permanently ( he is in the Air Force) before when I would be informed he was just visiting town once in awhile I didn’t let it effect me but knowing he here to stay has sent me into an obsessive spiral . Why does this still hurt me ? Why does am I obsessing over this I feel so dirty and unclean 

I feel like I am not clean enough for god or for any new partner in my life I’ve been celibate for a year but I am having such a hard time forgiving myself I’m still learning a lot about god but if anyone has any scriptures or testimony I could read I just need the words of God I don’t know what I need to hear I just feel so impure right now

""Why would an all loving, all powerful God allow such a place of eternal torment?""
Just didn't make sense to me and still doesn't.

-

Anyway, last week I was having one of my episodes where I talk to God and just be honest with him and tell him ""I just can't buy your religion, why would you allow x to happen?"" Etc.

I was just sick of it it was such a cognitive dissonance that I just wanted to be free of it to be able to live my life without feeling intellectually boxed in by this religion.

So after this I came up with an idea just in my mind alone. (Didn't speak it, didn't write it down). It was purely mental, and I barely even spelled it out that much in my head.

I just came up with the thought of ""If I could complete an online game flawlessly then God will set me free of Christianity and hell, but if not I'd go to hell"" I didn't even think those words out in my head but that was the idea

At the time it was more of a therapeutic thing because I just wanted to be free, and I was very confident I'd be at to do it as I'd been practicing a lot and was very knowledgeable of the game at that point.

I was just thinking ""I'm not going to fail bc I will be extra extra careful""

(I failed lol)

What could this mean, if anything?

Ever since then for this last week I have been absolutely mortified of what I've done and there hasn't been a second where I haven't been worried about it.

However, I've never seen a Christian person bow at the door. Some denominations cross themselves, but... Isn't it inappropriate for a non-believer to do so? It'd be like saying ""I believe in God"" while not believing, and doing so is hypocrisy (a sin, if I'm not mistaken).

Like Genesis, I find it hard to believe that the world was created in 6 days and that God made Eve from his rib, or that God killed humanity to start all over again with Noah and the flood. It doesn't feel real, more like a fairytale to me.
I also started watching more religious debates like Christian v Muslim, Christian v Atheist; and those debates seem pointless and childish from the religious part - because no matter what, they will never understand each other only because of their stubbornness. An intellectual debate should be open, and trying to learn from the opponent and hopefully learn from you, but these religious debates feel like they want to convert you, and prove that you are wrong and I am right.
I'm sorry if this upsets some Christians, but these doubts do not feel normal and more like a lack of faith.

- diverse body and church leadership 
- young people (I am 24) 
- Loving first but not appeasing/affirming progressiveness doctrines like homosexuality 
- SOUND BIBLICAL TEACHING!!!! I need a church that doesn't teaching blessings, sunshine and rainbows. Where they teach Jesus as our redeemer, that God as our Lord, our friend but God that is our Judge as well.

They argue that adherence to the laws of physics precludes the possibility of events like the resurrection of Jesus. However, as a computer scientist, I’ve never found there to be an inherent contradiction between accepting scientific principles and believing in miracles.

I’ve attempted to articulate how I think about this in the form of a thought experiment, which I’m sharing here in case it helps anyone who struggles with this. 

Premise: 
Belief in miracles and acceptance of scientific principles are not mutually exclusive. They can coexist when we recognize that the natural “laws”—descriptive models of consistent patterns we observe in nature that help us predict and understand phenomena but are not necessarily prescriptive mandates that the universe must follow—do not limit a transcendent creator’s ability to interact with the universe in extraordinary ways. Moreover, acknowledging miracles doesn’t undermine scientific practice because miracles are, by definition, rare and exceptional. The regularity of natural laws remains intact for scientific inquiry, as these laws describe the usual functioning of the universe.

Thought experiment:

• Imagine I develop an open-world video game with a sophisticated physics engine governing all in-game objects and players. Players can explore, experiment, and even deduce the underlying mathematical rules of this virtual universe.
• As the game’s creator, I embed special code allowing me to alter the physics engine’s behavior under specific conditions—say, when a player with a particular identifier (known only to me) is present. This special player (my avatar) can perform actions that defy the established physics, such as flying or altering other players’ attributes/state (e.g., spontaneously healing another player by altering their health attribute).
• For the vast majority of players and throughout most of the game’s history, the physics remain consistent and reliable. Players might spend years confirming the game’s physical laws without any indication of exceptions.
• When I choose to enter the game and exercise my special abilities, a subset of players may witness localized events that appear miraculous or impossible within the established rules. Other players, not having observed these events, may doubt their accounts, especially given the game’s long history of consistent physics. And yet they did occur. 

This demonstrates that a system can have consistent, reliable laws and still be subject to intervention by its creator, who exists outside the system and is not bound by its rules.",71,True,,,0.57,False,

**1. The way in which the grace of Jesus Christ is applied varies significantly among the Epistles.**

 

An important point we must not overlook is that the messages within each Epistle do not apply to all believers. The recipients of each Epistle are limited to those who belong to specific attributes of Jesus Christ. Many Christians commonly believe that all Epistles point to a single Jesus Christ, but in reality, their meanings differ. Each Epistle presents the Lord Jesus Christ as a Son of Man revealed in reality, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament.

 

**2. Each Epistle’s narrative follows what has been recorded in the Old Testament, aligned with a particular situation.**

 

Two thousand years ago, the ""First"" of Jesus Christ is in the heavens. and the specific audience for these Epistles is those who understand the ""Last"" of Jesus Christ (the mystery of Jesus Christ) and participate in His ministry. The Epistles are  timeless, the Epistles transcend time. This is precisely why Jesus Christ is portrayed somewhat differently in each of them.

 

**3. The author addresses the ""saints,"" called ""you,"" but the recipients differ in each Epistle.**

 

These differences are not easily understood and are anything but simple. However, to gain the right to the eternal Tree of Life, it is crucial to meditate deeply on God’s Word and discern these differences and their true meaning! All of this connects to the Book of Revelation. Those who are redeemed are written in each Epistle. We must seek out the most righteous, good, and acceptable messages to God among these Epistles.

 

**4. The way the grace of Jesus Christ is applied in each Epistle (according to different situations) can be discerned from the closing greetings within each Epistle.**

(Eg.)

**Romans 16:24**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.""

**1 Corinthians 16:23**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.""

**2 Corinthians 13:14**  
""The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.""

**Galatians 6:18**  
""Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.""

**Ephesians 6:24**  
""Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.""

**Philippians 4:23**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.""

**Colossians 4:18**  
""Grace be with you. Amen.""

**1 Thessalonians 5:28**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.""

**2 Thessalonians 3:18**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.""

**1 Timothy 6:21**  
""Grace be with thee. Amen.""

**2 Timothy 4:22**  
""The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.""

**Titus 3:15**  
""Grace be with you all. Amen.""

**Philemon 1:25**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.""

 　

 

**Hebrews 13:25**  
""Grace be with you all. Amen.""

**James 5:20**  
""Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.""

**1 Peter 5:14**  
""Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.""

**2 Peter 3:18**  
""But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.""

**1 John 5:21**  
""Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.""

**2 John 1:13**  
""The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.""

**3 John 1:14**  
""But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.""

**Jude 1:25**  
""To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.""

 　

**Revelation 22:21**  
""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.""

 

 

**5. Grace Connected to Revelation Chapter 22:21**

 

Instead of entering the lake of fire, there is the possibility of people existing outside, enjoying the grace of Jesus Christ (Revelation 22:15, 22:21). This potential can also be found among the writings of each Epistle. Each Epistle speaks to the assurance of salvation for the redeemed saints, yet, as mentioned in the prophecy in Romans, there are still those who remain subject to disaster and judgment. This is a sad reality.

 

Additionally, the Epistles contain passages about the sufferings that the redeemed saints will face. These are not only events of the past but rather predetermined events directed toward those destined for redemption and those who will be subject to disaster within each Epistle.

 

It is essential to carefully observe how the grace of Jesus Christ is applied within each Epistle. Furthermore, it is crucial to locate the Old Testament verses that align with the verses labeled ""as it is written"" in each Epistle, to understand the surrounding context. This understanding becomes the righteousness and life of the saints.

 

In the Epistle to the Ephesians, the grace of the First and the Last of Jesus Christ is recorded as a gift to be received by all, forming a link to the right to the tree of life described in Revelation 22.

 

**Revelation 22:14** Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

**Revelation 22:18** For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.

**Revelation 22:19** And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

 

Therefore, by deeply exploring what is recorded in the Epistle to the Ephesians and discerning its true intent, we can understand the meaning behind the mystery of Jesus Christ as the First and the Last, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End as described in the Book of Revelation.",0,True,,,1.0,False,

- Accepting Christ as your Savior in spirituality is the act of turning away from the distractions of the physical world and beginning to live from within, grounded in internal awareness rather than external influence.

- Surrendering to God means entering and remaining in a state of simply Being—a space of deep awareness without the noise of constant thinking or effort. It is an understanding and knowing.

Most every religious, psychological, spiritual tool and teaching is saying the same things in different languages to help people on different journeys and exists to direct you back inside, all essentially echoing the same truth. Unfortunately, many human minds have distorted these teachings for financial or power gains, keeping people’s focus on external sources rather than on themselves and their connection with God, Source, the Universe, or Higher Self.

Be cautious of any person or teaching that keeps your focus on tools, teachers, or anything external, rather than guiding you inward. Also, be wary of anything that encourages division.

Notes: Sometimes, releasing certain things or people is necessary to focus on your journey. This is not the same as creating division if it aligns with your inner path; you will recognize this difference. Additionally, some people may need external supports (like people, crystals, rituals - intentionally doing any repeated physical act for a result like prayer, routines, and yearly celebrations) while building faith, unlearning old patterns, and healing. It’s important to introduce the understanding that these things do not create change—you do. And as your awareness deepens, you may even come to know that the “you” doing the work is itself an illusion - there is only God/Source (whatever peoples language is).

Unfortunately, I expect pushback on this but still wanted to share in hopes that there might be some who are interested in seeing life through a more open lens. I am not interested in fighting or negativity here. I am here in love and appreciate anyone who receives this as such.

Scripture: Psalm 8:6-9  “You make him to rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet,   the sheep and the cattle, and every wild animal, the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and all ocean creatures. Our LORD and Ruler, your name is wonderful everywhere on earth!”

When your father is a mechanic, it pleases him to see you showing an interest in vehicles. Even just a little bit. Our Father is all power and He would really  be happy to see us not only praising Him for His great power but also desiring to walk in that power. The Father made available His power for that reason, so that we the children of God can walk in it. 


In Luke 12:32  the Lord Jesus says this to the disciples, that it is the Father’s good pleasure to give them the kingdom. He is not grudgingly doing it. He wants to do it and For this reason He created us in such as way that we are conductors and emitters of His power.

Our spirits can operate through the power of God. We are made in such a way that we can conduct divine power and emit it. This is not just about power and authority, this is also about making the Kingdom of God more visible on earth. 


How can it be visible when we do  nor demonstrate it? We need to make the world see the power and authority of God. The glory of the king is made manifest through the working of the body of Christ. We are not called to hide our Light but to showcase it.

Daily I pray to God and ask out to God for advice on how I should be living my life or how I should see myself and feeling as if I'm not as connected as I thought I was.

The reason: (skip if you wouldn't like to read my experiences with masturbation)

The reason I feel not as connected is due to the fact that sometimes I do masturbate and after doing so I feel very guilty and ask God for forgiveness in my mind. Which before you say I know it is a sin and I do attempt to prevent but it usually comes back, the urge I face. Which I feel very ashamed by. I pray to God everyday and I make it my soul purpose to join him someday in heaven and obey his word.

I want to praise God and hold in my heart that I love Jesus and the Holy Spirit but I feel deceived and shame myself for my own sin.

The population of our little village neared 100 if we're conservative (the census places our entire incorporated area at over 500, but includes Taylor). You had no internet, your main contact with the outside world was radio, and most everything was done yourself. My graduating class included one other girl and myself. There was a single church situated on the property of our pastor's farm which was two hours away by horse (there were no cars nor roads to drive them on). Alongside rest for the horses and helping around the property as an alternative to donation this meant that one was at church all day. The views held by this church were fringe to say the least. Or one would believe so, if they had only been exposed to mainstream urban Christianity.

A central doctrine to the community was that of Christian Dominionism and the belief that it was a moral prerogative to bring about the second coming. To ""end"" the material world as we know it and bring about the eternal salvation of all Christians in Heaven. The methods to do so were by control over the seven ""mountains"" of society: family, religion, education, media, arts and entertainment, business, and government. Now, voting was super common amongst our community, despite poverty, as nobody really ""worked"" in the traditional wage means. You built your house, you raised your own horses, you grew your own food (or shared food with neighbors), etc. So, taking a few days to head to the polls with the rest of the community was the only time other than when you went to get your ID at 18 that you saw ""civilization"" and it was always destitute (Taylor isn't exactly a bastion of economic success). It is safe to call our community a commune. Honestly, the simplicity of that life was nice.

After high school, I moved to Boston to attend Harvard. I had a major culture shock there, as you can imagine. I started to become interested in philosophy and many of my professors and peers were atheists, and I had lived disconnected from any need to defend my beliefs. I began to question everything I had learned while being confronted with a much faster paced and individualistic culture. And then I went to a concert and was publicly humiliated after being sexually assaulted while people recorded. I was called a liar by my rapist, my lawyers told me I had no case, and that I was better settling. And the charges were dropped. I dropped out of school, was homeless for a bit, got back on my feet and then I began dating, royally fucked up my first serious relationship. And it seemed like everything I had been taught to believe was crashing to the ground. I wasn't sure of who I was anymore. I quickly became disillusioned with evangelicalism. I fell into the ""debate lord"" pipeline, absorbing all the big arguments against religion and diving deep into atheism. The logical side of me was hooked on the idea that free will and faith were illusions.

I began to practice traditional Mesoamerican religions during this time, not out of sincere belief, but as a reaction against the neocolonialist mindsets that seemed all too prevalent, and a desire to connect more with my aging grandmother, herself a Maya transplant to America and victim of the residential school system.

I began dating another woman and for the first time, saw a Christianity compatible with my values. A Christianity that didn't seem apocalyptic or dogmatic. Yet I remained fairly resolute in my stance that Christianity was irrational. Tragically, my partner passed away. I was devastated. In my grief, I did something I never thought I’d do again – I went to church. Not for the theology, not even for faith, but to angrily shout at a being I didn't even believe in. Because it felt better to be angry at some external thing than to accept the randomness that is cancer. Because I felt hopeless and useless. And, it worked. There was a peace, a comfort, in shouting to the void. I found a Christian community that’s far removed from the evangelical culture I grew up with, a community that openly mourned with me and for me and comforted me when I was in need. To be completely transparent, I’m still not philosophically convinced of the reality of God or any theological claims. But I am convinced that having a relationship with whatever, however imagined or real, is comforting and feels real. So here I am – back in the faith, not because I can logically “prove” it, but because it fills a need in my life that nothing else has.",3,True,,,0.71,False,

Ever since I've started growing in my faith, participating in theological discussions aswell as preaching to my friends and ensuring myself in my faith, I've started to just feel, happiness out of nowhere everytime I'm about to go to sleep.

Smetimes it makes me nearly cry of joy because It's such an odd feeling to actually grasp the fact that I have someones watching over me at all times, who loves me and keeps me safe, and I've never been more rested than recently.

I (22M) am born in Latvia, to a catholic family on my father’s side. When I was 8 we moved to Sweden, and I’ve assimilated very well and now call myself Swedish. When I was around 15 I chose to attend the “konfirmation” (confirmation?), it was a year of going to the church regularly, learning about god and Christianity, I grew close to my priest and we are now good friends to this day. 
When I started the confirmation at the church of Sweden I was officially a catholic, but during that time chose to convert to Church of Sweden. I didn’t think much of it then as my parents are not religious at all, they may believe in god and all but I can’t even remember when the last time was that they visited a church voluntarily…

Til this day I am still a member of the Church of Sweden and I am trying to find my faith, I sporadically read the bible and attend church every now and then on Sundays. 
Today I had a discussion with a colleague when we had to talk about death and handling death, which obviously later lead to discussions of a more religious aspect. He is a religious catholic and he strongly felt like that was the right thing to be, and he seemed to have a bit of a reaction when I told that I used to be catholic but turned Protestant.
This caused me to reflect on weather it was the right thing to do. On one hand I now live in a very Protestant-dominated country and it might be easier to build community-relationships with people that live nearby etc if I attend the Church of Sweden. 
On the other hand there is the aspect of what one thinks is more suited to one’s beliefs. Without having dedicated too much time to research arguments for Catholicism vs Protestantism I feel like Protestantism puts more weight on the individual relationship one has with god, while Catholicism seems to put more importance on the church as a institution. At the same time I do sometimes get weirded out by certain parts of the Protestant church and how woke it has become… thank God I haven’t had to experience this myself, the churches I’ve attended have been nice and somewhat conservative (for a Protestant church).

Another thing that maybe keeps me from the Catholic Church is that I think love is something every human has the right to have, if both parts are in love that is, but the Catholic Church seems sometimes a bit too conservative… 

I don’t really know what I want to achieve with this post, I guess I’m more looking for different ways to look at things and different arguments for me to reflect on.",2,True,,,1.0,False,

Deuteronomy 32:8-9  
When the Elyon (עליון) gave the nations their inheritance,  
When He divided mankind, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the bene Elohim(בני אלהים),   
For the YHWH's (יהוה) portion is His people,  
Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.

  
This comes directly from Moses himself, even though earlier in the chapter he says God made and established the Israelites. Does this verse prove El gave YHWH Israel as an inheritance, because just based off this, it sounds like Moses is polytheistic and believes that YHWH was one of El's 70 sons. I tried looking this verse up on forums and the questions were very lackluster and the answer were mid. Keep in mind I am using the Dead Sea Scrolls version because it's older/more accurate. I know the Masoretic text says ""Sons of Israel"".

What used to be a community for exploring Christianity, discussing scripture, and supporting each other on our faith journeys has turned into a battleground for divisive American politics and ideological clashes. Too often, people are judged as “good” or “bad” Christians based on how they vote or which social stances they take, rather than on their commitment to Christ and their personal spiritual growth.

As someone who isn’t American, I find it hard to care about these political debates. I didn’t come here to have my faith experience sidetracked by American political divisions. Faith should be about seeking truth, growing in love, and deepening our relationship with God, not about scoring points in a culture war. But here, it’s almost impossible to find a discussion that doesn’t get pulled into debates over secular agendas. It’s exhausting and disheartening to watch faith itself weaponized to push ideological boundaries.

examples:

'thou shalt have no other gods before me,’ was replaced with ‘resolutely guard against the infiltration of Western ideology,’

John 8:3-11 (according to the communist party), Jesus once said to the angry crowd who was trying to stone a woman who had sinned, ""He who is without sin among you, let him cast a stone at her."" when his words came to their ears, they stopped moving forward. When everyone went out, Jesus stoned the woman himself, and said, ""I am also a sinner. But if the law could only be executed by men without blemish, the law would be dead.""

Im from Finland and I have had a faitly christian upbringing as is usual for my age here. As a kid i never really knew what to think of it all and as a youn teenager in a school and group full of atheists i never really found my ways so to speak. 

For a long time i had been bondering some huge guestions about how the world as we know it started and how is everything so connected around the world before it really being possible not to mention all the ancient belief being so similar ( yes i went full on anunaki and ancient aliens and spirituality conspiracy mode). After bondering those guestions for years i have piece by piece started putting all the things in order from a Christian perspective and it looks more like i have had all the right pieces and asked the right guestions but been inturputing them the wrong way. Looking at them from the perspective of bible and other ""non-canon"" sricpture it all starts to make sense and im feeling really drawn to it.

I have my doubts still about sertian belief that goes against the bible as i know it, things in my mind that are out dated (mostly society stuff and accepting everyone and everyone being able to live lives as they see fit and what feels right for them without being sinful ). Many things ive learned so far are making me feel better about stuff being out of contecst ( for example why shoud we not eat pork. Cause it carried diseases back then and therfore is outdated, im sure you know what i mean).

So to get to the point i was wondering what could be the first steps of getting more knowledge from the bible. Sadly just reading it would take me ages cause of my dyslexia and not being sure if i should read it in Finnish, or english or some other language? What would be the best translation? Etc. If there is someone who could maybe help me with these id really apriciate (preferably someone from my own country so there wouldnt be any language barriers and theyd know more about Finnish translations of the bible).

I went alone during the morning.
Stayed there for around 20 minutes. I prayed, walked around and looked at how beautiful God's earthly kingdom is, I sat with my thoughts for a bit.

With time I felt more and more comfortable.
After leaving church I felt really light and felt the energy of God for sure.

Can I bring my bible and just read at church?
Is there anything I should do or ask in Church?
How do I adress the bishops?

I really hope you'll read the whole thing, though.

**I grew up in a devoutly evangelical home with no clue that I was gay.** A classmate nicknamed me “God Boy” because I was always trying to witness to folks at school. 

Growing up, I spoke out on issues that I believed should be important to Christians—including homosexuality. Like many posters here, I often said, “I’m not homophobic, but I believe being gay is a sin. The Bible is clear that it’s not God’s best for us.” And to this day, I’m still convinced that I wasn’t homophobic. I didn’t hate or fear gay people; I just wanted to share the truth in love.

There was a lot I didn’t understand. I had always been taught that people *chose* to be gay, and I had heard “ex-gay” testimonies of people who said God made them straight. So I firmly believed that anyone who chose to be straight could be. **I thought about being gay as a “lifestyle,” so when I said anti-gay things, I wasn’t trying to hate on specific** ***people***; I was trying to take a stand on godly sexual ***behavior***.

I spent years trying to ignore my own attraction to guys and lack of attraction to girls, believing that would change with time. It took me years and years to admit the truth to myself: that I had feelings I had never chosen, and that those feelings—not necessarily sexual behaviors—were what people meant by the word “gay.” When my own church and Christian friends turned against me for admitting to my feelings (though I was not, and no intention of being, sexually active), **I finally started to realize why so many gay people had been angry and resistant to my message**—and why they had such a negative view of Christians. 

My intentions had been good! But I had wrongly pushed people away from Christ by preaching at them instead of listening, and now people were doing it to me.

**I’ve spent the last 25 years of my life in ministry to LGBTQ+ people.** I’ve written books and made YouTube videos on the subject, and I’m now very well known as a gay Christian. When you see people on here talking about the evils of gay people, I know they’re talking about people like me, and my name gets thrown around a lot in these conversations.

But I want to encourage everyone here to have mercy in both directions on this. When someone says, “I’m not homophobic but I believe being gay is a sin,” don’t just downvote and argue with them. Please try your best to assume good intentions.

I know the subject gets old after a while—trust me, I’ve been having the same conversation for 30 years now!—and I appreciate how many people here want to stand up in defense of our LGBTQ+ siblings. But I also believe that **there are many sincere, devout, Bible-believing Christians who are genuinely trying to speak the truth in love and who don’t realize how their words sound on the other side. I didn’t.** I was worried that the culture was moving away from God’s will and taking the church with it, and I just wanted to point people back to Scripture. I think that’s a good instinct! This is just a more complicated subject than many people realize.

The adversary came to Jesus for example and asked for a stone to be turned into bread, and to fall from a great height and survive. Jesus rebuked these. Sometimes he would refuse requests for demonstrations of miracles. That covers the ""evidence"" part that is otherwise a common feature in court.

When asked questions about the message, he would often dodge the question. For example, the Essenes once asked who you're married to in Heaven when you marry a bunch of widows who die in quick succession. Jesus simply said God is the ""God of the living, not God of the dead"". And when the woman was being stoned, Jesus said ""you're hypocrites, your argument is invalid"". This covers the ""cross-examination"" part that is otherwise a common feature in court.

The pharisees at one point complained Jesus was testifying against himself, and he said ""I am sufficient to testify against myself, for I know where I came from and know where I'm going, and you don't"". There the court concept of ""witnesses"" is thrown out, which is the last of the three main concepts typically used in court to gather a comprehensible outcome from a conflict.

I grew up Amish. I was told that, if you wanted to know what a verse meant, you had to look at other verses and compare and contrast the verses, and that this was a part of Bible study, to ""surround"" the correct message. I don't think Jesus' message itself is negative, but when I see verses like these where Jesus finds reasons to not conform to what we today might call the normal process of coming to a solution, I wonder if the Bible is telling us to abandon due process. It could be the Bible is simply telling us that if Jesus' message and the normal process ever come into conflict that you should choose Jesus' message, as him overriding the normal process with his message might imply, but that still amounts to abandoning the normal process.

I left the Amish late in life after seeing my mental state deteriorate in the process of observing how people will ignore the normal process in favor of Jesus' message or even their own message, not even as a last resort. Whether it was ever Jesus's intention, watching people do whatever they want because they knew history's most important man could get away with it and still receive praise broke me, and I often wonder if Jesus at least knew people would do that as a consequence, and if he would be looking down on a world later on where people in court often laugh in each others' faces and act as judge, jury, prosecutor, and executioner when all you came in for is a speeding ticket. It was enough to give me DID and I fled, though the voices of my family live on in all the voices I encounter that insist my issues are not real.

Because I know the philosophical issue of standing up for oneself was a contentious one in Jesus' time, I also think back to when Jesus said ""those who live by the sword die by the sword"", which I think of as it is ironic considering he spent three years dodging the normal process, for better or for worse, which I'm sure was at least similar to today's due process, which is legal procedure. How are those reconciled?

I remember appearing before a committee and someone was able to successfully lay false accusations towards me, saying ""I don't need proof, and I can testify against myself, for I am a believer"" and they asked which side of ""the divided house I stand"" if I valued the normal process so much. The devil, who I still believe in along with Jesus and perhaps God, is literally weaponizing Jesus in his own house, and I feel like something somewhere in this whole thing isn't working.

How can someone be as close to their envisioned model of fairness as they can be, while keeping their cruel memories with them that placed value on it which I know can really jam the orderliness into you, but also have someone a part of them who died running amuck of what the Romans considered proper analysis, knowing it validates the very thing I caution against that would make me ask some of the same questions as the judges of Jesus, especially the individuals who specifically say it was the disillusionment in the court process that made them Christians?",0,True,Support,support,1.0,False,Support

Beyt + Resh together form the word Bar meaning “Son of” (in Aramaic, in Hebrew it is Ben)

Shin = Two front teeth meaning Sharp, Press, Eat… (the function of the teeth when chewing; consume/destroy)
Yud = Arm meaning work, make and deed; the functions of the hand
Tav = Crossed Sticks meaning Mark, Sign, Signal, Monument

So the first word in the Bible, in the beginning, holds this idea (according to the claim);
The Son of God (will be) destroyed (by His own) work on a cross. Even from the beginning, the Son of God was to die on a cross for us by His own hand to save us from our sins.

**The Meaning of the Visions in Revelation**  
  
  


**1.    Those who sing the new song in Revelation 5** = Those who were foretold in the Old Testament prophecies as ones who would sing the new song.

 

**Revelation 5:9** And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.

**Revelation 5:10** And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

**Psalm 40:3** And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.

**Psalm 144:9** I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

 

In Revelation 5, it is described that “they sing a new song.” This new song was foreordained in the Old Testament prophecies as a song sung by the redeemed. The true meaning of the new song is not merely a song praising Jesus Christ from two thousand years ago; rather, it is limited to those who belong to the Son of Man in reality as foreordained in the Old Testament (linked with Revelation 2 and 3). Those predestined for redemption are the ones who will come to understand the true meaning of the new song, a meaning concealed within the hidden significance of the prophecies.

 

Therefore, to be among those referred to as ""we"" in the Book of Revelation 5, one must properly understand the meaning of the new song recorded in the Old Testament. Only those who have been chosen and redeemed as foreordained in the Old Testament are identified as ""we"" in Revelation. To fully grasp the new song, it is essential to understand the context in which it is written, as the Old Testament contains prophecies on how the new song is to be sung.

 

 

**2.    The Redeemed in Revelation 7 = ""They"" in Isaiah 49:10**

**Revelation 7:14** And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

**Revelation 7:15** Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.

**Revelation 7:16** They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

**Revelation 7:17** For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.  
  


**Isaiah 49:8** Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;

**Isaiah 49:9** That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.

**Isaiah 49:10** They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

 

 

In Revelation 7, it is foretold that those in white robes have come out of the great tribulation, washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. It is also said that they shall not thirst anymore, and the Lamb will lead them to living fountains of water, and God will wipe away all their tears.

The vision in Revelation 7 aligns with the content in Isaiah 49:10, a prophetic book. Isaiah 49:10 describes the Lamb leading the redeemed, which indicates that the prophecy in Isaiah 49 must be fulfilled for the vision in Revelation 7 to come to pass. This ultimately presents one possible application (or scenario) of the visionary prophecy in the Book of Revelation.

So, what does this signify? Jesus is currently in heaven, and He has revealed the mystery of the seven churches (Rev. 1:20, Rev. 2-3), which unveils the ministry of the Son of Man—one whose identity must be revealed in reality.

 

**3.    The Vision of the Tree of Life and the River of the Water of Life in Revelation 22**

 

**Revelation 22:1** And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

**Revelation 22:2** In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

**Revelation 22:3** And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.

**Revelation 22:5** And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

**Revelation 22:7** Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

**Revelation 22:9** Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

 

John sees a vision of the tree of life and the river of the water of life through an angel. This vision aligns with the content in the final chapters of the Book of Ezekiel.

 

**Ezekiel 47:6** And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

**Ezekiel 47:9** And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.

**Ezekiel 47:12** And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

 

The important point here is the phrase, ""The \[Lord\] God gives them light, and they shall reign forever"" (Rev. 22:5). This carries a slightly different nuance from the blessing at the end of Revelation, ""The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all"" (Rev. 22:21). This verse suggests a situation where the grace of Jesus Christ is not being applied.

Furthermore, the Lamb in this vision symbolizes the Son of Man in reality, who conveys all the messages in Revelation to people. This Son of Man in reality represents the one who sees all things, as John did, and bears witness to the rejected Lamb who fulfills the prophecy of Ezekiel for the people (Rev. 10:11; 22:10).

Shall we revisit Revelation 22:7? The one who is coming quickly here is not the Lord Jesus Christ. This is because the phrase ""Behold, I come quickly"" is divided into two distinct sections in Revelation 22.

 

**A.**    Behold, I come quickly

 

**Revelation 22:6** And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.

**Revelation 22:7** Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

**Revelation 22:8** And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.

 

If the Son of Man in reality receives a vision from God’s angel as John did, and carries out the ministry commanded in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 10:11, to prophesy again regarding these visions), then the events seen by John will unfold as foretold. The Son of Man will declare the truth of all the visions he has seen to the people in reality and will sacrifice himself to prevent impending calamities. For this reason, he will be called the “Lamb.”

As written, it is the “Lord God”, not the Lord Jesus Christ, who will shine light upon the redeemed, and those who are redeemed will be limited to those who follow the ministry of the Son of Man. Additionally, the one who is coming quickly in Revelation 22:7 can be understood as the angel whom God sent to John, rather than the Lord Jesus Christ.

 

**B.**    And, behold, I come quickly;

 

**Revelation 22:12** And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

**Revelation 22:13** I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

**Revelation 22:14** Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

**Revelation 22:15** For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

**Revelation 22:16** I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.

**Revelation 22:17** And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

**Revelation 22:20** He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

**Revelation 22:21** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 

If the Son of Man in reality is granted the attribute of “the First and the Last” of Jesus (Rev. 1:17), he, as the living Jesus Christ (seven lampstands = seven churches = the Son of Man), will bestow “Grace” and reward upon all humanity (Rev. 22:16, 22:17).

This signifies the forgiveness of the judgment and destruction foreordained for all humanity who rejected the testimony of the Lamb, shifting them from those destined for the lake of fire to those outside. (Rev. 21:8 -> 22:15)

 

 

This is something that can be accomplished when the mystery of the First and the Last of Jesus—namely, the First of Jesus from two thousand years ago and the Last of the Son of Man in reality—is fulfilled. (Rev. 1:18, Rev. 22:17)

 

God has given the saints the freedom to choose “Righteousness.” The events foretold in Revelation represent the calamities and judgment destined for humanity. Yet, God has revealed the mystery of Jesus Christ as a means to avert these judgments, encapsulating it within the beginning and the end of the Book of Revelation.

 

A. Those who can avoid the judgment and calamities that are foreordained to occur are limited to those who are familiar with the content of the Old Testament prophetic books that align with each chapter in Revelation and who partake in His ministry (e.g., Rev. 7:17 = Isaiah 49:10). The Son of Man, who proclaims these things in reality, is depicted as ""John"" and ""the Lamb"" in Revelation (he is rejected by people → judgment and calamities follow as a consequence).

B. The right hand of Jesus rests upon John (the Son of Man) (Rev. 1:17). This contrasts with the situation where God, through His angel, shows John the things that must come to pass (Rev. 1:1).

Jesus describes His mystery as the seven stars and the seven candlesticks (Rev. 1:20). Through this, we can see that the angel sent by God and the angel sent by Jesus are recorded separately! (Rev. 1:1, Rev. 22:16)

 

 

Revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.  
Revelation 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

When we analyze these verses carefully, we can understand that:

  
The seven golden candlesticks = the seven churches,

and the seven stars = the angels of the seven churches.

  
The seven churches represent the Son of Man, reflecting the attributes of Jesus Christ (Revelation 2, 3), while the angels of the seven churches serve to reveal the identity of Seven churches.

Revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.

Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

From this, we can see that the Son of Man and His messenger are portrayed as the man and woman who appear in Revelation 22, referred to as the Spirit and the bride. This is the very mystery of the seven stars and the seven golden candlesticks that Jesus speaks of in Revelation 1:20.

 

**4.     Summary**

Seven golden candlesticks (Revelation 1:13) = Jesus Christ (Revelation 1:17) = Seven churches (Revelation 1:20) = The actions and thoughts of the Son of Man in reality (Revelation 2, 3) = The Spirit (Revelation 22:17)

  
Seven stars = Angels (messengers) of the seven churches = The bride who reveals the identity of the Son of Man in reality (Revelation 22:17)

 

Revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.  
Revelation 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

 

**5.    The Choice of the Saints for Humanity (Free Will)**

 

What choice will Christians make? Will they look upon the Lamb, slain while bearing witness to the ordained judgment and tribulation, or will they seek Him, who as the ""Last"" of Jesus Christ, bestows grace upon all humanity?

 

In examining the long-awaited return of Jesus Christ in detail, such elements have been hidden. Revelation, by definition, means to bring hidden things to light.

At the end of Revelation, the Spirit and the Bride declare that anyone who wishes may take the water of life freely.

This signifies the gospel that emerges from a man representing the ""Last"" of Jesus Christ (Revelation 22:16) and his messenger, a woman (Revelation 22:17).

Their testimony completes the attributes of Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last, allowing some to remain ""outside"" rather than enter the lake of fire.

 

**Revelation 22:13** I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  
**Revelation 22:14** Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

 

A.    The Son of Man in reality can be either. As John, he can leads the redeemed to the tree of life through his ministry (Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, the Almighty, or Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End). This signifies that only those recorded in the Book of Life through the work of the Lamb will receive salvation.

 

B.    As the ""Last"" of Jesus Christ, he may complete the ""First and the Last"" of Jesus Christ, extending love and grace to humanity (Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, First and Last). This means that, through the fulfillment of the Lord Jesus Christ, grace is applied to all humanity, allowing them to avoid the foreordained tribulation as those who remain ""outside.""

I have an extended family member who has Alzheimer’s who was recently placed in a “memory care” facility (old folks home). He only has two people who go visit him, and unfortunately, not very often. His room is undecorated, and I would like to change that. I would like to decorate his room so that when he looks at the walls, he smiles and just knows that someone loves him, even if he can’t remember who. I can print out photos I find online, but I don’t want to just use random stock photos. Im not very artistic and it would take me a long time to fill up the walls by myself. I was wondering if there is anyone on here who might be willing to help me decorate the walls of his room with uplifting artwork. 

This man is a good man but he is “unloved”. He is a man of God who has always tried to do right, the type of person who genuinely cares about others and is ever generous. The type of person who has never met a stranger. He also served in the Navy on a sub for most of his life. He spent his life loyally pouring into and serving others. Unfortunately due to interpersonal/relationship conflicts throughout his life, he’s been cast out/ignored/ left behind/ disregarded in his old age. It’s so hard to go through dementia and still hold onto one’s dignity. I want to be able to give this man some positivity in the face of such an uncomfortable situation. He’s lived his life constantly giving of himself and now at the end, the people he gave so much to have pretty much left him abandoned. Can we show this man some love?

For those who are willing to help, here is a list of things that bring him joy and some art ideas I’ve had. (FYI, he can’t read well anymore. He may recognize some words, like LOVE, GOD, PRAY, HERO, THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU, but he can’t read full sentences anymore)
- God, Jesus (a Lion and lamb, rainbows, cross, praying hands, dove with olive branch, angels, anchors, etc)
- Navy related things (Submarines, beaches, oceans, seagulls, fishing boats, something with the word “Hero”)
- Things related to the mid-west of the US (Navajo, donkeys, mules, horses, Grand Canyon, red desert with rock formations, etc)
- Flight simulator
- Birds (he used to live bird watching)
- Flowers and other beautiful things in nature

Halloween is next. I am no longer deceived. I want to follow the Lord. And his messengers have shown me Halloween is not of God. It doesn’t glorify God. It is a day of devils.

I have seen many testimonies from ex satanists , ex witches warlocks etc who have confirmed that it’s a day of evil and a day they specifically wait for to do rituals and every time I’ve went out to “celebrate” the Halloween “Holiday” I have actually been participating in a ritual wether I know it or not. 

I know to us it may seem harmless, just dressing up, getting drunk, trick or treating but none of this is of God or glorifies god in anyway. Even when I didn’t believe I kind of knew deep down this isn’t godly. 

The lord tells us to not partake in the celebrations of the world Halloween is no different.

Jeremiah 10:2-5

Thus says the Lord: “Learn not the way of the nations, nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens because the nations are dismayed at them, for the customs of the peoples are vanity. A tree from the forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman. They decorate it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move. Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.”

Weekly Bible Study: 29 October 2024

Theme: Bible Basics Explained/Anxiety 

Scripture: Ps.139:13-18 & 2 Tim. 1:7

Message:

Fearfully & Wonderfully Made

Hello once again, and welcome back to Bible Basics explained. We're back in Psalm 139 in part one of our series on anxiety.  In the first six verses, we are known by God fully and thoroughly. In the next six, God is with us. Nothing can separate us from His love. And today the third stanza, and one of the most beloved passages in all scripture. Let’s begin at verse 13:

“For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."" (Psalm 139:13-14)
How beautiful is that? God made us. And He made us to be full of fear and wonder. Wait - hold on. Did that say full of fear?

Well, yeah that’s what it says, ""Fearfully and wonderfully made."" But remember - the Bible's word for fear can mean fright or terror, or it can mean reverence or awe. Same word, different application. We were made to be full of awe and wonder at all of God’s wonderful works, and to stand in reverence of God. But sometimes we get it twisted up and just end up full of fear - the scary kind.

The two are kinda similar when we think about it. It’s like two girls walking up to the edge of the Grand Canyon. The first one steps up alone and looks out overwhelmed with fear of what would happen if she fell. The other one steps up, amazed and awestruck at the sight in front of her, but fully confident because her Dad is holding her safe. Both responses are captured by the Bible word fear. They’re looking at the same awesome sight. The difference is - one of them knows who is with her.

And her Dad is awestruck to know that the One who made all that made him too, and holds both him and his daughter safer than any earthly dad ever could. We are fearfully and wonderfully made.

Remember 2nd Timothy 1:7.

“For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind” (2 Timothy 1:7).
When we have anxiety, particularly anxiety disorder, it can feel like our brain isn’t working right. But remember - God made us. And though our bodies and our minds are all broken and bruised in various ways here in this life, it is not a mystery to Him. He knows and He understands. And He allows and ordains our weaknesses, and He can even work through them. And He also heals them in His time. And through all of that, we are still made in His image. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. And our value to Him is not diminished in the slightest by our weaknesses. In our weakness, He is strong.

Verse 15:

“My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.""(Psalm 139:15)
That’s poetic language for our momma’s womb. God was there - from the beginning. He knew. He had a plan, and He still does. Verse 16:

“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."" (Psalm 139:16)
That one’s a little mind-boggling. God ordained our days. That doesn’t mean that He makes the bad things happen. But it does mean that He saw them coming and He can handle them. The difficulty of today looks a whole lot smaller through the lens of eternity. Verse 17:

“How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!"" (Psalm 139:17).
Okay, this one can be translated two different ways, and most Bibles will tell us in the notes, that this can also be read,

“How amazing are your thoughts concerning me, oh God. How vast is the sum of them” (Psalm 139:17, alternate translation).
Do we ever wonder about that - what the Creator of the universe thinks about us? David is amazed at it - and just how much He thinks about us, how many thoughts go through His mind about us and our lives. Verse 18:

“Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand—when I awake, I am still with you."" (Psalm 139:18)
When it comes to anxiety, sometimes it can feel like our thoughts are just spinning out of control. And yet with so many things to worry about in our lives, our thoughts still don’t feel like enough to cover it all. But God’s got this. He’s thinking about us, and His thoughts for us are mercy and grace. And there are plenty enough to cover all our worries.

 That’s a great place to stop for today. Stop and just ponder that one. Wonder at it. After all, we were created for wonder. Made to be filled with it.

So here I took a challenge to read entire bible everyday by the end of the year 2025

But here’s the problem where I don’t have the money to buy a physical bible so I took my friends to read everyday 

So I have started a YouTube channel where I’m posting the everyday Bible reading challenge 
And to keep me motivated I have kept a challenge here for every YouTube subscribe I will read a chapter.

Like the idea of John The Baptist “leapt” in the womb upon hearing about Jesus. Or what Jesus said in the garden right before his arrest.   
  
Everyone else was sleeping so it's unlikely they couldn't have heard him. The Disciples were in hiding when Jesus went before  Pontius Pilot and was crucified.

For example, we live in an urban-ish area which is pretty safe, and we are smart enough to decide for ourselves if it is safe to go out or not. His parents will text and call him and say that it's not safe to leave the house and that he's being irresponsible. His mom will stay up all night until she knows that he's home for the night. If he decides to stay out, she will call him and tell him that he's hurting her and won't let her sleep. I can't really describe this well, but basically they still treat him like a child. We've had many conversations about this, and he's worried about hurting his parents' feelings because he loves them.

First of all, I am agnostic. I am christend though. 

Just over 13 months ago I had a traumatic event which has carried on since then yet can't (due to reasons) get therapy until hopefully around 3 months.

I have in the meantime though attempted some good and some bad ways to cope including becoming slightly more interested in religion. 

I live in a Protestant country but in a Catholic region meaning that there is an open church I like to go to once in a while. 

I love but don't understand Buddhism fully but understand Christianity so use the church to pray to the universe and today I prayed to send a message out to someone I saw be detained due to not paying for a ticket. 

Anyway, I had a dream last night that my Grandma had died when she didn't and I started asking why and tearing up. 

I don't know if I'm lost and I'm sorry I've rambled but what does this mean? It didn't bother me when I woke up, thank you. ",2,True,,,1.0,False,

They don't like how Christianity has changed my personality so much and has made me arrogant. I am very unapologetically Christian but at the same time maybe I shouldn't be.

We just launched a feature called *Talk with the Bible*, where you can engage in conversations similar to talking with a pastor, helping you reflect and find encouragement on your spiritual path. Check out the app here for iPhone users: [Inspirit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspirit-your-faith-guardian/id6480348915)

Attempts to explain and illuminate its contents have brought more confusion than understanding.  Questions continue to outnumber answers.  There have been a plethora of publications that have attempted to clarify the meaning of its content.  We are so preoccupied with what is going to happen, that we fail to spend our energy on what is happening right now.  There is a far-sightedness in so many of us that we have lost our near-sightedness.  End times supersede present times.  The Second Coming of Jesus has provoked more interest than His first coming.  Coming judgment has attracted more interest than God’s Grace.  Escapism has replaced preparation for difficult times.  We are more concerned about the future than about the present.  We are looking for signs in the sky rather than seeing the signs of this time.  We are so eager to know about tomorrow, that we fail to grow spiritually today.  Instead of reading every book that claims to have unlocked the symbolism of Revelation, let us read what is obviously clear and let the Holy Spirit unveil the veiled Truth in God’s timing.

This article is not an attempt to explain the Truths in the book of Revelation, but to simply illuminate what should be obvious to the reader.

It is the only book in the Bible that pronounces blessings on those who read, hear, and keep the things revealed. (Revelation 1:3)  There is also a warning to those who would add or take away from the prophecy of the book. (Revelation 22:18, 19)  Those who would dare to venture into explaining the book should be aware of these warnings.  Obviously, Revelation is a book that must be taken seriously, especially by those to whom is intended.  The prophecy of Revelation is purposely directed toward seven churches in Asia Minor.  The Apostle John was to write what was revealed to him and send it to the designated churches.  These revelations were addressed to the Angel (pastor, messenger) of each of the specified churches.  Notice that John was “in the spirit on the Lord’s Day” when these prophesies were given.  To try and understand Revelation by reasoning and intellectual manipulation will only add to the confusion.  Take a look at Jesus’ exchange with His audience when He shared about drinking His blood and eating His flesh.  The people were so confused with His words that many of His disciples stopped following Him.  Jesus clarified what He was saying by stating that His words were not for the fleshly hearers, but for the “spirit” which would bring life. (John 6:63)  It is only when we understand this principle that we will be able to grasp what is being offered in Revelation.  We must stop looking at the book of Revelation with natural minds.

In reading the book of Revelation, we need to center on the obvious and let the rest of the Book remain in a passive state until the Holy Spirit opens our understanding.  Instead of spending countless hours in search of the veiled Truth, let us digest the revealed Truth.  For over 1,900 years, Christians have sought to see the future revealed, while they have missed the Truth for contemporary living.",10,True,,,0.5,False,

I've written about this person in letters. I've prayed about this person. I've also prayed for me to be like a good enough partner like to be worthy enough for this person but it's been 2 years and I received nothing. I'm really tired, and I'm really starting to lose faith. It's not just because of this but because of other things in my life and I know that God gives the toughest battle to the toughest warriors. But I've been battling since the day I was born actually and I can't battle anymore. I'm really really tired especially going through it alone with nobody near me or by my side. Especially the one person i feel like i really need, this person that I've been dreaming of like for forever and I've been praying about and I've been writing letters to God to mother Mary to jesus to everybody about really. I just it's getting tiring and it's getting to be too much. I really just need him. I really just need my husband, my man and I've been praying about him for 2 years and I still haven't received nothing. But I got really really deep about my prayers like recently too (5 months ago) because I've been devoting myself to orthodox catholism so i veil more and I pray on a regular basis and everything but I'm losing faith and I can't keep praying while all these different issues keep popping app all over the place. And  the 1 person I need to be able to take care of me and be able to help me and everything is not there. So if you could please pray for me to get my ideal partner really really soon. Like thsi week type soon. Cause i know somethingis gonna happen this week. Honestly I'm so tired like I'm so tired and I'm in school so I can't actually just even decide that I wanna fly away. Firat off where did I get the money from (from my future man HOPEFULLY) but also I can't just decide that I want to run away Because I also have other people to support. I can't run even though I so badly want to but I need someone there with me to go through this with me. or to be able to like just support me through it and I don't have anyone. not even friends who i have been praying for as well. I've been praying for my people, my friends but I also don't have that and God hasn't given me that. So it's just it's getting to me. Which is why if you guys could pray for me that would mean a lot. And i would really really appreciate it. Thank you so much in advance tp whoever does pray for me, make God bless you all And forgive everybody's sins Amen",1,True,Support,support,1.0,False,Support

It genuinely felt like I was awake and what was happening was real. I remember checking the time when I woke up and it was at 3 AM. Recently I’ve been waking up around that time every night.

Then he answered with something I never thought I’d hear him say. He said the word ‘impossible’ on its own. He was implying that it is impossible that the Quran is the word of Allah. This made me utterly confused. How did a hafiz and a practicing Muslim turn into someone that didn’t like the Quran at all. My father was a very good Muslim and even did hajj seven times before the rule of only going once was made. My father was a hafiz who memorized the Quran fully. I never even knew drifting away from a religion this much was even possible… until I witnessed it. This happened all through text as we live far away from each other.

I feel compelled to share my concerns regarding the increasingly popular fashion hijabs, particularly those by brands such as Vela Hijabs. These companies market their products in an appealing manner that has captured many. Behind the glamorized pictures is a deep, essential sellout of the hijab's purpose, essence, and sanctity.

Let us not forget that the hijab is much more than just an accessory. This is not a fashion statement; neither is it a canvas for embellishment. The hijab is an emblem of modesty, humility, and subordination to Allah's commandments. When companies like Vela Hijabs promote their products using models that commit Tabarujj with excessive makeup and styles that are far from proper hijab, they exploit our faith for profit. This is completely disrespecting the very soul of hijab and defeats the values it was meant to uphold.

These brands are cashing in on this fashion trend. Being on trend with the latest in hijab fashion, rather than something dignified and a sign of our respect and belief. The hijab was never meant to be adorned in ways which draw undue attention or align with standards set forth by the fashion industry.

Let us all keep our eyes open and hands outstretched towards brands that respect our faith without compromising on our value. Fear Allah and cease to encourage companies through your purchases, those that ridicule distorted presentations of the hijab. Instead of looking up to the latest fashion trends, let’s look up to the wives of the Prophet peace be upon him. Look up to their complete faith, and modesty.

One of the most famous journalists in the USA, award-winning Bob Woodward, is best known for his investigative reporting, particularly his work on the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. He recently published a new book that delves into the behind-the-scenes stories of three significant conflicts—Ukraine, the Middle East, and the struggle for the American presidency. In his section on the Gaza crisis, he reveals details of discussions held during Blinken's visits with various Arab leaders and how they reacted to the ongoing conflict. Here are some highlights:

\- The U.S. and Iran gave assurances to each other through back channels that neither wanted war. - Qatar has promised the U.S. to disavow and kick out Hamas after the conflict is over.

\- Netanyahu deliberately and in a concentrated effort prevented humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. When confronted, he offered to let in ""experts""; he was reminded that starving people cannot eat or drink an ""expert.""

\- Netanyahu was absolutely terrified of Hezbollah having been part of the initial Oct 7 attack to the point he contemplated a pre-emptive strike. He was relieved when he found out that wasn't the case.

\- Egypt gave Israel/U.S. extensive intelligence on Hamas, including their tunnel networks and operational strategies. Egypt even advised Israel on how to maneuver in Gaza.

\- Saudi Arabia was very close to normalizing with Israel; however, Oct 7 ended all of this. MBS said to Blinken that 70% of his population was young and oblivious to the Palestinian cause. Now they are exposed to it constantly, and for there to be normalization, a clear Palestinian pathway is needed. When Blinken presented this to Netanyahu, he declared the need to come up with ""creative wordsmithing,"" i.e., a solution that is not real.

\- The Republicans endorsed giving Saudi Arabia security assurances in exchange for normalization. Lindsey Graham said it was crucial the normalization was done while the Democrats were in office because otherwise, they would never vote for ""going to war for Saudi Arabia.""

\- The U.S. is increasingly worried about the perception of Israel as a rogue state.

1gh3zck,To My Sisters: How to Recognize Sincere Intentions in Marriage Proposals and Protect Your Heart,Zestyclose_Flow_680,2024-11-01 12:17:29+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1gh3zck/to_my_sisters_how_to_recognize_sincere_intentions/,16,/r/islam/comments/1gh3zck/to_my_sisters_how_to_recognize_sincere_intentions/,islam,"Salaam everyone,

After spending time on this platform and speaking to people from different backgrounds, I’ve come across something that deeply concerns me. Many wonderful sisters here are looking for a sincere, God-fearing spouse. But I’ve noticed that some men approach marriage without genuine intentions, using manipulative tactics to attract interest, only to disappoint and hurt in the end. It pains me to see this pattern, and I feel a responsibility to share what I’ve observed so that, insha'Allah, it may help you make more informed decisions.

Here are some key signs and strategies I’ve learned that may help you discern a person’s true intentions. Remember, these aren’t foolproof, but they can provide guidance to help you recognize sincerity and protect your heart.

# 1. Look for Depth and Consistency

* **What to Watch For**: Sincere individuals don’t rush things, and they approach marriage thoughtfully. Someone who genuinely cares will have consistent actions and words over time. Be cautious if his behavior changes depending on his mood, your reactions, or who else is watching. Consistency is a foundation of integrity.
* **Why It Matters**: Someone who changes their behavior frequently or acts in a “too good to be true” way might be putting on a show. Authenticity tends to remain steady, while false intentions will fluctuate.

# 2. Genuine Interest in Your Values, Not Just Surface-Level Qualities

* **What to Watch For**: Notice if he’s curious about your beliefs, goals, and values, not just your appearance or basic details. A sincere man will take the time to get to know what matters to you and will encourage discussions about compatibility, faith, and family.
* **Why It Matters**: A man who focuses only on the superficial often lacks depth in his commitment. Marriage is about partnership and shared values, not just initial attraction. Someone interested in building a future will ask questions that reflect a genuine curiosity about who you are.

# 3. Respect for Boundaries and Comfort Zones

* **What to Watch For**: A man who respects you will honor your boundaries, both emotional and physical. He won’t pressure you for personal information early on, and he will respect your timeline for involving family members or having deeper conversations.
* **Why It Matters**: Respect is non-negotiable. When a man respects your limits, he’s showing that he values your comfort and autonomy. If he pushes boundaries or makes you feel uncomfortable, it’s a sign that he may lack the respect required for a balanced, loving relationship.

# 4. Transparency and Honesty in Communication

* **What to Watch For**: Pay attention to whether he is open about his own background, life goals, and even flaws. If he avoids certain topics or gives vague answers, it might indicate he’s not being fully transparent. Sincerity often comes with vulnerability; a genuine person won’t be afraid to share details about his journey.
* **Why It Matters**: A marriage is a partnership that requires honesty. A person who avoids transparency might be hiding aspects of their life, and you deserve someone who’s willing to be open, even if it’s difficult.

# 5. Willingness to Involve Family and Friends

* **What to Watch For**: While everyone’s timeline is different, a sincere man won’t avoid family involvement indefinitely. A healthy relationship includes building bonds with family and friends as a way to form a strong support network. If he avoids bringing family into the conversation, ask yourself why.
* **Why It Matters**: Family involvement in marriage discussions often solidifies intentions and provides accountability. A man who is genuinely invested will not hesitate to include those closest to him, showing that he’s proud to introduce you to his life.

# 6. Open to Discussing Challenges and Differences

* **What to Watch For**: Marriage involves navigating life’s ups and downs, and a serious man will be open to discussing potential challenges, even if they’re uncomfortable. Avoiding real-life topics like finances, family expectations, or values differences is often a sign of immaturity or avoidance.
* **Why It Matters**: Facing issues head-on is a sign of maturity and readiness for marriage. A person who isn’t ready for these conversations may not be ready for the commitment that marriage requires.

# 7. Trust Your Intuition and Take Your Time

* **What to Watch For**: If you have doubts, listen to them. Your intuition is a powerful tool, especially when coupled with guidance from prayer and reflection. Don’t ignore small red flags or any uneasy feelings. If he’s truly interested, he will respect your pace and won’t rush the process.
* **Why It Matters**: Many people have a “gut feeling” when something is off, and often, this feeling is there for a reason. Give yourself the space and time to observe fully, and let your intuition guide you.

These observations aren’t meant to create fear or suspicion, but rather to equip you with the knowledge to identify sincerity and protect your heart. You deserve a partner who values you deeply and shares a vision for a meaningful, faithful marriage. Remember, you are worthy of respect, love, and honesty. Trust that with patience, faith, and clarity, you will find someone who embodies these values.

May Allah guide you to a spouse who brings out the best in you, respects you wholly, and helps you grow in faith and love. And please, if you have other insights, share them here. Together, we can support each other in finding the right person, insha'Allah.",3,True,Relationship Advice,question,0.9,False,Relationship Advice

There are certified halal logo in this country and as I see, KFC and pizza has certified halal logo on it, same goes to chicken/beef sell at the supermarket. 

I do further research on the halal logo, from whom association that released on the halal logo and found out that the head of this association(Caucasian Muslims Office, CMO) is Sheikhul Islam Allahshukur Pashazadeh, which is a shi'ah. 

This are the information I get about him from ChatGPT :

""Pashazadeh himself has taken a unifying role, avoiding clear identification with either Sunni or Shia sects. The Caucasian Muslims Office promotes Islamic unity, seeking to bridge differences between the two sects in Azerbaijan and maintain harmony. Therefore, Sheikh Pashazadeh is seen as a figure who represents both Sunni and Shia communities, rather than aligning with one particular sect.

In his leadership role, he emphasizes the importance of Islamic solidarity, especially in a country like Azerbaijan, where both Sunni and Shia Muslims coexist peacefully.""

I've tried as best as I can, researching on the internet, on youtube, going to tripadvisor, asking the imams, eating only eggs and rice for already like 3 weeks now and today I also called a mullah from my country(Malaysia), and he said, the chicken/beef over here is confirmed halal and there are no doubt about it. I ask the same things about about the imam from the sunni mosque i went to, and he said everywhere in azerbaijan, the food is halal. 

I also watch youtube videos of Sheikh al-Hakeem that says, if he is in a corrupt aqeedah country, if he's Muslims and if there's no proof that their aqeedah is corrupt, just eat it. 

At the same time, I also watch other videos, that says otherwise, or says depends on which sects there are. 

With all this information that I shared, kindly advise brothers and sisters, what's your take on this ?

Sahih al-Bukhari (3406), Sahih Muslim (2050).

[Commentary]

“We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gathering kabath (fruits of the arak tree)” meaning the Prophet ﷺ was with some of his companions in a valley called Marr al-Zahran as mentioned in other narrations. They were by an arak tree gathering fruits which are similar to figs and are eaten by animals and people. This took place towards the beginning of the Islamic period, so the Muslims found it difficult to find food to eat.

So the Prophet ﷺ told his companions, “Choose the black ones, for they are the best,” meaning the black fruits are better in quality and taste. “They asked, ‘Were you herding sheep?’” Meaning when the Prophet ﷺ told them they should choose the black ones, the companions asked him, “were you herding sheep” because only someone who knew about herding would know such details and know which one tastes better. So the Prophet ﷺ replied to them saying, “There was no Prophet except that he herded them.” Meaning every Prophet that was sent herded sheep, including our Prophet ﷺ! This shows that prophethood was given to humble people rather than those who have a lot of wealth or worldly positions. Herding sheep is a job that requires patience, and so this helps the Prophets with patience and the like. Herding sheep is difficult, and working with sheep is a humble job. Herding sheep is a simple job, which helps prophets to maintain a simple lifestyle. There is a lot of wisdom in this; the more one thinks, the more they will find out!

And Allah Knows Best.

1. Intention in the heart to purify oneself from filth. 
2. Then say Bismillah before the shower. 
3. Then wash the hands 3x, after which you wash private parts from any dirt. 
4. Then do wudu:
1. Intention in the heart
2. Say Bismillah
3. Wash hands three 3x
4. Rinse mouth three 3x
5. Rinse water in nostrils 3x
6. Wash face and beard 3x
7. Wash arms 3x
8. Wipe head once
9. Clean your ears once
10. Wash feet 3x
11. Then say this:“Ash-hadu an la ilaha  illal lahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluh.”This means “I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.” After this statement he would make the following dua: “Allahuma j‘alnee mina tawabeen waj-‘alnee minal mutatahireen” Which means “O Allah, make me among those who seek repentance and make me among those who purify themselves.”
5. Pour water on head 3x while making sure it    reaches the roots
6. Wash your entire body, starting with the right then the left side, making sure all of the body is washed

Now my questions are as follows. 

Can I say Bismillah in the bathroom? As where I read these from, it say that says: say Bismillah before the bathroom"", but then when in the bathroom, I would have to say Bismillah again for the Wudu part of Ghusl. 

When everything is done with Ghusl (I have washed the entire body), is that it? Nothing after that and I am considired pure from filth accumulated pre Ghusl?

Of course I have done research myself but nothing that answers my question properly. Can I say Bismillah in the bathroom?

Again, feel free to correct any mistake that I have said, because I just want to learn more and get closer to Allah SWT. ",3,True,Seeking Support,discussion,1.0,False,Seeking Support

Jami at-Tirmidhi 3713

Those who interpret the word ""mawla"" in the hadith as ""friend"" should pay attention to, Hz. Ali's words in the incident of rahba. If it meant friend, would it not be as follows: ""Ali is the friend of anyone of whom I am a friend""?
- Did the Prophet not say it several times related to the contract of brotherhood?
- What was the use of making thousands of people wait under the scorching sun just because of the concept of ""friend""?

Also:

On the day of Ghadir Khumm in 632 CE.. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) declared Ali ibn Abi Talib to be his mawla and supporter. He asked Allah to support those who supported Ali and to be enemies with those who were against him.


In Shia Islam, the term ""Mawla"" refers to authority, guardianship, and being more appropriate than the believers. It signifies a position of leadership and authority over a matter or a community. Also, we think Ali(AS) was supposed to be the first caliphate. So I was just curious how in Sunni Islam mawla means friend. Not trying to divide the ummah or be arrogant just a real question because I’m curious and since this is what created the two branches of Islam in the first place.",1,True,General Discussion,discussion,1.0,False,General Discussion

I have a question about Jannah. I am unfortunately not able to hold myself back and sometimes do self-harm (cutting myself) to avoid worse things (suicide) and I really regret it but I can’t stop doing it but I also hate myself for it. I hate the way I look like and I don’t even know if I’ll ever be able to get married to a woman because of them.

My question is whether I will keep theses scars in Jannah if I should make it there (May allah azzawajal let us all reach it). I really can’t sleep sometimes even at the thought of having this forever. It’s a nightmare for me to even think about having them forever in this dunya.

My question is about the lyrics, it's not bad that i can say it's haram and it's not that good to say it's halal 100%  
  
This is the lyrics :  
  
The king and his men  
Stole the queen from her bed  
And bound her in her bones  
The seas be ours  
Beyond the powers  
Where we will, we'll ruleYo, ho, all hands  
Hoist the colours high  
Heave ho, thieves and beggars  
Never shall we dieYo, ho, haul together  
Hoist the colours high  
Heave ho, thieves and beggars  
Never shall we dieYo, ho, haul together  
Hoist the colours high  
Heave ho, thieves and beggars  
Never shall we die

Some things to consider :  
1- Difference between hearing and listening since my content is shorts so you don't probably focus on the lyrics or anything you forget most of what you heard.  
2- The voice is so deep that you barely can define the lyrics unless you search about the song (Some ppl could still hear the lyrics i am not so sure about this tbh)

I have the same question about this lyrics which is other song's lyrics that i used :  
  
It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad  
Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?  
It's just a cigarette like you always used to do  
I was different then, I don't need them to be cool

My question is about 2 things here  
First : The bar that says ""Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?""  
Second : the 2 bars ""It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad"" and ""It's just a cigarette like you always used to do"" a woman says them, on the editing software i use i changed her voice a little, so is it fine or not?

I’m a revert! People always tell me Allah likes when we ask him for things all the time. That we should make dua and request things every single day. But I genuinely can’t think of anything to ask for. I have everything I want. To clarify, I’m not bragging about my life being perfect. It’s far from it. I’m not even close to being rich. I just have enough to get by. But I’m simply so grateful for everything that I do have and I’m not someone who has big appetites for worldly things so I can’t even think of things to ask from him. 

I’m a teacher, my life isn’t exciting in any way, I’m happiest when I’m inside my comfy home being alone and I like it that way. The only thing I can ever think of asking Allah is just the general “give me what’s best for me in this world and in Akhirah”. So I don’t spend time making dua every day and asking for things for myself like people suggest I should. Of course I make dua for other people but that’s not the point of this. 

Is what I’m doing sufficient or should I be asking for more things because people tell me that I should do that for a greater reward in Akhirah. Because apparently Allah saves our duas for the day of judgement if he doesn’t answer them here. 

Because instead of asking Allah for things, my dua is usually just me thanking him for things that he’s already given me. 

This may be a dumb question but I’m just curious about this topic..

Can I just request for things in Akhirah instead? Like what I would like to have in Jannah if I ever end up in there?",7,True,Question about Islam,question,1.0,False,Question about Islam

Coming straight to the point, i am a practicing muslim and i am trying to be better pursuing my religion. So i have been almost prohibiting everything i can to keep myself away from haram stuffs. Music (i was a huge fan of music back days), social media (time wasting and posting pictures to keep myself away from the urge to show myself up), mixing up with dudes or even talking to them, putting on less makeup and wearing loose garments as well. So as a south asia cultured person these things are quite difficult for me to maintain but Alhamdulillah i am more than successful restricting myself to the point that i dont feel the urge to repeat these stuff in my life.

But i was always fascinated about gaming from my very childhood, i used to play games but again, due to the restriction and my busy schedule i even stopped playing video games (cause according to scholars they are forbidden to PLAY). Now like i said i loved video games so, i decided to watch ppl playing video games on twitch/yt.   
I have fascination over the world creation, story building and at some extend the mechanics and physics of any game. I have no intention to fancy over a character or shirk in particular. I just enjoy watching them with zero shirk or even anything bad.

They believe what ever hardships that they go through is a punishment from Allah.

There is no such hardship in this Dunya that is supposed to be a punishment from Allah. In fact, its the opposite. Hardships are blessings. Why? Because they turn you to Allah and bring you closer to him. 

Whether its fake friends, getting fired, failing your test, loosing your own parents, they are all things that make you cry in Sujood and wake up every middle of the night to pray Tahajjud. These signs are what show that you are not being punished but being blessed. Allah rewards you for your patience, and if you have Tauhid.

The real punishment from Allah is when you stop praying, stop reading the Quran, stop believing in Prophet Muhammad’s S.A.W message and when you get distant from Allah.

So do not be sad and do not get depressed when you are faced with the toughest hardships. Remember Allah has once said in the Quran, “Indeed with hardship, (comes) ease.”

I was raised as a Christian (i went to a Christian school where there were weekly ""prayers"" during assemblies, celebrated Easter and Christmas), then I became agnostic a couple of years ago and then decided to revert to Islam maybe a little over a year ago now. I decided to revert to Islam because of a personal conviction and the signs in my life. I've always believed in 1 god/deity (The Christian trinity never made sense to me) and I would also consider myself as being close to god (Even while I was a Christian).

My parents are Islamophobic Lithuanian nationalists and are EXTREMLY Intolerant of Islam. my mother is Christian and my father is an Atheist. The Lithuanian media produce brazen lies about Islam (The media are VERY Pro-Zionist and Islamophobic), and they believe in it. in the past, my dad was absolutely clueless about my reversion, but my mom was very suspicious about it. when they found out, my mom told my dad so now they both know. My mom thinks that only Pakistani people are Muslims, she keeps saying to me that ""we are not these people"" my dad believes the absolute lies that the islamophobes say (like with terrorism and all of that) btw they don't watch any British media.

It is very hard to find a time to do Wudu, Salat or to find Halal food (unless i am at my best friends house). i cannot pray Fajr on weekdays because my parents take my phone away at 22:00. Some days, it is impossible to do any prayers. My parents shop at Aldi or Lidl and they do not sell any halal meat. i tried to convince them to go to another shop because i know that they sell halal meat but they were not impressed.

I do not know how i am going to be able to fast Ramadan next year or to celebrate Eid. during school days, I've made a strategy to avoid haram food, i eat halal food in school and then eat very little or whatever halal stuff they have (like fish) or sometimes even fast at home.

My closest friend was born a Muslim. I have spoken with his parents about my situation. His parents do not want to take me to the Masjid until I am legally an adult (18) because there are people from my school who would recognize me there. I am immensely grateful for the support that his family have given me. however, i am considering of going to the masjid to speak with a scholar, because my life as a revert is getting harder (I'm sure that this is a test from Allah SWT). my mom doesn't like it when i go to my friends house, but my dad is fine with it. i have a curfew of 18:00 whenever i go out, and now i am not allowed to go to his house every so often or on weekdays (his parents said that). There are plenty of Mosques around the city, but i live on the outskirts so it takes a while to get there. i have only been to Mosques on school trips.

My school doesn't have a prayer room (for Dhuhr) and I cannot go to the school for help or support because they would tell my parents. They will also force me to go there on Eid. But now I'm not sure how this is going to play out as they found out just yesterday. (i drafted this paragraph a while ago, so its a bit outdated sorry)

i also go to a youth organization which is like the military but for kids. the place is filled with English nationals (i suspect some of the staff to be far right) and i don't feel comfortable there. Nobody there is a Muslim and nobody there knows what my true faith is. they are also ordering me to shave my growing beard, but I've used my hair condition as an excuse to not shave. I'm thinking of quitting as i need to focus on my Deen and my exams.

what should i do? it has been very grueling living as a revert. My parents don't understand that by law, I have the right to religious freedom, but also i do not want to speak out as i love my parents very much. I'm thinking of running away or maybe applying for council housing when I'm older but i also want to Emigrate from the UK. i don't think i am mentally strong enough to withstand this for another 3 years, but then again, Allah doesn't overburden beyond what we can bear, and also it says in the hadiths that ""hellfire is surrounded by desires and paradise is surrounded by hardships"" these have somewhat comforted me in my religious journey searching for the truth.

Note: my parents found out about my faith after an argument about Islam after we saw a Dawah stand on a day out with my family. My mom accused me of being a Muslim again, but up until then i was docile and quiet about it. this time I've had enough and decided to stand up to their oppression and for my faith. (they found out on (30/10/2024)) i drafted this post a while ago and forgot about it, but now that my parents know about my religion, my life has been getting harder, so i feel that i need to post this ASAP. sorry if some of the information seems outdated or in the past. they didn't say much after that and i kept my mouth shut when they asked me. i also feel like they will publicly shame me for my faith. i also edited the post a bit because the autobot wont let me post",7,True,Seeking Support,discussion,0.93,False,Seeking Support

I’ve been experiencing some challenges lately that I find difficult to understand. I genuinely want to pray, but I often struggle with intrusive thoughts that leave me feeling paralyzed at prayer time. When I do manage to pray, I experience severe paranoia that overwhelms me. I often sense a presence behind me, which adds to my anxiety.

In my daily life, I’ve also been feeling depressed. I currently have no job or car, and I know I need to turn back to Allah and pray, but I feel unable to do so. This internal struggle is deeply distressing. It’s not that I don’t want to pray; rather, when I try, I lose control—I start shaking, twitching, and my words become tangled. This situation leaves me feeling hopeless, and I worry I might give up entirely because I can’t reconnect with my Lord.

Please keep me in your dua.",2,True,Seeking Support,discussion,1.0,False,Seeking Support

Assalamu alaykum,

I wanted to share something that has been weighing heavily on my heart. I’m a Muslim revert, but my family doesn’t know yet. I come from a Christian family, and although I’ve found peace in Islam, it’s been an incredibly difficult journey keeping my faith hidden.

Growing up, I always felt like something was missing. Christianity never quite clicked for me. I went to church, attended religious schools, and did everything expected of me, but I never felt that deep connection with God. A few years ago, I was introduced to Islam, and for the first time, everything made sense. Alhamdulillah, I reverted, and I’ve never felt more at peace spiritually.

However, my family has always been very vocal about their negative views on Islam. They’ve made hurtful comments, and I know they wouldn’t understand my decision. Because of that, I haven’t told them yet. I feel like I’m living two lives trying to stay true to my faith while pretending to be someone I’m not around my family.

Every time I pray, I do it in secret, worrying they might walk in. I hide my Quran and prayer mat, and I feel so anxious trying to balance it all. I’m constantly afraid that they’ll find out before I’m ready to tell them.

I also have to make excuses about food, pretending to only eat certain things to avoid conversations about halal food. And I still have to attend church sometimes and participate in Christian holidays, even though it feels like I’m betraying myself. And since I study Arabic and I have an Islamic class at my university and I told my mom I don’t wanna go to church anymore my mom got really mad and yelled at me and said bad things like I can’t be muslim, I can’t revert to Islam. 

This has left me feeling so isolated. I’ve distanced myself from people who don’t support Islam, and it’s been hard finding others who understand my situation. I’m trying to go to the mosque and make friends there. 

I love my family, but I love my faith too, and sometimes I feel so torn between the two. I’m not sure how to navigate this. If anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

JazakAllah khair for reading. May Allah guide us all and make things easier for those going through difficulties.

Not sure if this is a good way to phrase it. I've been struggling with my faith for almost a year now. Things I once had no issue doing seems hard for me, I've started indulging in sins I never committed before. I can't even recognize myself, yet I try to come back to Allah. I've struggled a lot with my salah, more than ever. I genuinely have no words. I hate myself for it everyday. I've started going against proper hijab (makeup,nails,etc). I've started interacting with men (friendly but still haram). Without exposing my sins; let's just say I'm not the girl I used to be and I've tried so hard to go back but I've never been in a situation like this. Anyways, point is I'm probably the worst Muslim ever now. My iman is not the same and it's a struggle. Despite all the haram and moving away from Allah, my life seems to be going good. I've abandoned salah for the most part yet my life is ""good"". Every dua I once made for back when I was more practicing is coming to play Alhamdullilah yet for some reason I only feel regret and afraid that this is Allah only giving me this dunya. It's a scary feeling and from this point on I really want to go back to Allah. I've never had this much distance from Islam. But I also don't want to just ""go back to Allah"" because of my new blessings in life, do I make sense? Is this overthinking? I need help. I need to go back to being a good muslim yet I fear I'm only having an ok life now because Allah has let me go; He's only given me this universe. In that case should I be afraid? Should I be happy my duas from before are coming true? The same duas I made when I was extremely practicing and would pray tahajjud for? The same duas that were rejected time and time again yet only are accepted when I'm far from Islam? What do I do?

Ive done terrible sins and im convinced ive ruined my future chances of marriage

I havent done physical zina but over the past 2 years ive gone out of my way to seek women, specifically ones way older and some who post provocative pics for a career, to chat and try to get friendly with. I hate myself for it. Its my own fault. Some wanted me because i was an easy pushover, some liked the fact i was a virgin and some just wanted me to give them money so in return theyd talk and treat me the way i want to be. 
I realize how terrible it all is. I never did send any money but man oh man was i close to.

The conversations I did end up having was the women showing me very very revealing pictures, toying with me, flirting and i let it happen because it was me who sought them out. These women are called dommes and if you dk what those are please im begging do not google it. I just thought if i got to know a woman online it would fill the void in my heart that i have, of loneliness and horrible self esteem and insecurity, but it just made jt worse. Some people even told me to just stay away but i couldn’t and i just craved that warmth and fake love i thought these women would provide. Long story short our conversations lead to me feeling aroused and what not but i didn’t go further. Was literally just me putting these women on a pedestal and seeing them as superior to me.


I just feel ashamed as a young man. I spent so many nights wishing i didnt have those disgusting haram online conversations with these women way older than me, but you cant change the past. Im just glad i didnt commit actual physical zina but what ive done is probably just as terrible. 

Its why im exposing myself. Maybe i can find some sort of help here because im tired of my addiction to 🌽 and im at all time low. Anyone, please, help me.",5,True,Seeking Support,discussion,1.0,False,Seeking Support

I’m really afraid to wear the hijab. I just feel like I’ll have more future. I’m an ugly person, a bit like a witch: thin lips, big and crooked nose, long face, … . My hair definitely helps me look ‘normal’. 


I don’t want to wear a hijab because I know that no one will want to marry me. There are not that much muslims where I live and I feel like that the muslim girls are really pretty Allahuma Bareek. Every hijabi is pretty. On tiktok and instagram I always see them and I will never be able to be even close on their level. I don’t want to be old, alone and embarrassed. And I don’t want to embarass my parents by being unmarried. I know that it looks like I’m overreacting but I’m not: no one would want to marry an ugly person like me. With hijab my chances will go from 0,1% to 0%. It’s just unfair that I’ll live my life miserable because I’m born this way. Sometimes I even blamed my parents because they made me.

The worst part of all is that I have a loving family. Especially my father, he is a really good person, husband and father. He wants me to wear hijab but will never force me, just encourage. The same thing with my brother, he always asks what’s stopping me from wearing the hijab. But how could I answer that the reason is that I’m too ugly? He would be really sad and tell my father and then my father would cry. I don’t want to be pitied and to make my family sad. I don’t want to hear them say that I’m the prettiest girl on the world, they say this often and it makes me mad. I even thought of killing myself because of this but that would also kill my parents. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t pray often anymore because I lost all hope. I don’t feel motivated to read Quran, pray, … . Because I don’t have anything to pray for, I’m too miserable. 

If anyone has something that will help me, please help me. I can’t kill myself but I also don’t want to live life miserable till my death comes. I’m thinking of going to therapy but my parents will know then that I have mental problems and I don’t want to worry them. I also can’t tell my friends because they think that I’m a really happy, social and bubbly person.

Salam Al Aquim,

I recently have been having this regret for rejecting hand shakes due to making the situation awkward for the opposite gender. 

To bring in some context, I recently started Brazilian jiu jitsu in order to follow one of the Prophetic Sunnahs of grappling. With this, I found a gym where I told them from the beginning that if it was okay if I did not spar with females. They were understanding. At the end of the class however, we would all line up by belt rank and shake everyone’s hands. In this case, I first would oblige but I started to feel regret in shaking the opposite genders hands. 

I am married so I asked my wife the best way to deal with this and she said just bring it up to them nicely and also put your hand on your chest and smile and show respect still. I decided to this recently and I came into class early and I notified 2 of the coaches (one male and one female) before hand to not cause any embarrassment or disrespect. They were fine with it and were not bothered. 

However, later one of the head coaches came in mid class and once the class ended and we lined up, I put my hand on my chest and smiled and did not shake her hand which caught her off guard. I felt like it might have offended her and another female was also caught off guard. After the class I did explain myself to both the females as it is because I am Muslim that I do not shake hands with the opposite sex out of respect. They did not take any offense and were fine with it. 

But I felt like after that incident I was being mocked from some of the stuff I was overhearing but again it could have not been related to me at all. that’s when my heart sank and I felt like maybe I did something wrong? While we were sparring, I was sparring with a male and the two females who I had to explain myself to I kind of overheard laughing and then were saying “be careful”, “don’t get us in trouble.” They were saying this when a female was coming to walk me through a submission.  

Now I know some people will say to quit BJJ altogether but I don’t really think that solves the amy thoughts? Because I know I did the right thing but I don’t know why I am feeling so down about this?",3,True,Seeking Support,discussion,1.0,False,Seeking Support

Hope you all are doing fine.

I am using fragrance from last 3 weeks. its actually  a impression of oud but a legit one .I have received multiple compliments for the fragrance as its projection and  lasting is much high as it is very strong but much pleasing. The issue I am facing from last 3 weeks is that I am constantly facing bad dreams. In some days I even recieve bad dream in the first hour of sleep and it makes me to wake. so if I sleep again same happens. And it's happening constantly from last 3 weeks. And dreams are so bad that in dreams someone my close dies something chasing me or I am in a condition where I cannot move. It's so disturbing for me

Should I avoid using perfume or it's a myth that if you use strong fragrance you attract JINS .

I read a Hadith in which it has mentioned that if you see bad dreams you should spit 3 times on left side.

  
So if someone can relate it with fragrance use it would be helpful for me",2,True,Question about Islam,question,0.67,False,Question about Islam

Yes there is a wealth of information on family problems and how one should deal with it through Islam but I can't find a learned scholar who specifically talks about those who are singled out in the family. Most of the information on black sheeps is from people who go through it on Reddit post which I'm not knocking and may they find peace but not much help/information from those who are learned on a situation that is observed to exist that is the black sheep of the family.

Anyone know of any links where someone who's qualified learned in Islam specifically talk about this phenomenon of the black sheep in the family.

Some are straightforward — like Costco and Walmart, which are obviously out because they sell pork and alcohol. But what about stocks like Amazon? I mean, you can buy pork and alcohol on Amazon too! And then there's Google, which opens the door to all kinds of content, including some that definitely aren’t halal.

Here’s where it gets even trickier: there are rulings that consider certain stocks Sharia-compliant despite these issues. For example, NVIDIA and Apple are considered halal by some standards, but I can’t help but question it. Almost every major company, including these, has debt on its balance sheet involving interest (riba), which is also haram. But, if 99% of companies have riba on their books, is it even possible to invest in a way that’s 100% halal?

I’d love to hear your thoughts; how do you navigate investing while trying to stay Sharia-compliant? Is it a lost cause, or are there clear guidelines to follow",10,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.8,False,General Discussion

Asalamualaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa barakathu, brothers and sisters, I’m in need of advice and dua. Over the past couple of months my parents have been fighting very frequently and it’s been getting to the point where they are cursing each other and implying that Allah will punish them and take care of them on the day of judgment.

My father is in majority of the wrong here, he’s has some narcissistic traits and is essentially taking out all his built stress and anger’s from other problems in his life on my mother. Their marriage life has always been rocky and they’ve had fights in the past, but recently due to some new problems and stresses it’s gone to another level with a fight happening almost once every few weeks. 

I agree with my father on one thing, my mother has overtime become more direct and harsh with him, but even then she keeps a balance and only will be harsh whenever he himself is being harsh with her or doing something wrong. My father thinks he’s in the right on everything and believes he is right to treat her this way because to him she isn’t doing anything right. Again, my mother needs to be much more supportive, but a lot of her being angry with him is a direct result of his own actions. 

My problem with my father is why is he making these small things so serious and to me it’s concerning because he seems overinvested in this dunya. I want to explain to him and possibly get him to understand  as well as get my mother to understand, but I don’t know what I should do or how I should say it. All I know is that we as Muslims, whenever we see wrong we must correct it and I know that I can correct this, but I don’t know how to go about it. 

Please give me advice and most importantly make dua for me, my siblings and my parents to be guided in the straight path and to be able to overcome our problems with each other and the affairs of the world. Ameen. Barakallahu feekum ",3,True,Seeking Support,discussion,0.67,False,Seeking Support

I can't do anything, I have a big aching in my stomach and even if I try to focus on salad and  prayers about other things I can only think about him. I want to be genuine but I can't. I also leanred that Allah said "" I am what my servant thinks of me"" so if I truly believe that Allah can bring him and me back in connection, it can happen. But I dont know if it's me or the shaitan telling me that it can't happen.  And I also read another muslimah's story and she said something a long the lines of 'Allah won't make me beg and cry for something he won't give me' And that's all I do, beg and cry to Allah for him to come back to me. Im failing school, and I need him. I love Allah, but its so hard to have certainty that Allahrespond and make my dua come true, because I have so many doubts, how do I get rid of that?",2,True,Relationship Advice,question,0.5,False,Relationship Advice

Is it due to kind of any evil effect? Some of my relative felt some presence in my parents room. I'm confused, is it because any spirit doesn't want us to move ahead especially me and my father. Please guide me. I just spoke to my mom, and she is not well right now.

I’d also like to find out if anybody else is going through the same thing. I’m a Muslim and I try to practice my religion everyday. I pray 5x a day and read Quran. 

I have recently in the past year suffered a lot of OCD leading to anxiety regarding my religion. My brain tries to turn everything halal to haram, and tries to find reasons that I can’t do things. It’s really making me miserable as I have high goals and ambitions, however my brain makes me think that they are haram by finding rulings and opinions, even if they are minority to make it halal. This makes me feel stuck and I don’t feel like I can do things in life. 

For example, I really want to start a business. I will do it the halal way, and I know that business is halal and trade is encouraged in Islam. However, for example, my brain says I can’t and that it’s sinful and haram because if I start a successful business, I live in the UK so I will have to pay tax on it, and the UK spends some tax in arming Israel and this means i’ll be sinful. It probably sounds silly, but this is the reality. I always finds this happens with things that make me happy and goals that I’m eager to achieve.

My OCD goes from simple halal things and always goes further into detail to make it haram for me. Has anybody else experienced or experiences the same thing. I don’t know if this is a test from Allah or not, but it’s really messing with my mental state and i’m struggling with decision fatigue. I’m constantly looking online for fatwas and scholar rulings to prove or disprove things and it’s begging to make Islam difficult for me to practice. Thank you!

I am considering going back to school to pursue a MA and perhaps a PhD afterwards. My initial thoughts were to get these degrees in Philosophy since that used to be a passion of mine when I was younger. I'd like to study something that will help me improve and grow my faith, so I thought that Philosophy would align with that; I'm starting to think that I might be mistaken on that front. I see online that there are degrees in Islamic studies, but I'm not sure what exactly those entail, which are reputable schools/programs, or on which path to proceed. My BA is in English Education, so I likely won't have any prerequisites completed. Also, I live in Texas.

Where should I go to school? What degree(s) should I pursue regarding Islamic studies? What careers might I be eligible for with these degrees? Any help that y'all can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Recently I had an ankle surgery and I'm unable to bear my full body weight for at least 4 weeks. I only use my crutches to walk to the toilet and my surgeon told me to avoid the bandage getting wet.

Regrettably, I left a couple days of prayer, however now I'm trying my level best to pray while sitting.

My first question is, is my wudhu of washing the hands, arm to elbows, face, hair and one leg, while wiping a small amount of water on the bandage sufficient? I'm having doubts and that's affecting me mentally.

In the roughly 6 days I skipped prayers, about 2 of them were because I was left in an impure state after a wet dream, and couldn't clean myself without help from my parents who have to go to work.

Second question is, for the days I left prayer due to the immediate recovery from my surgery, am I exempt from them or am I obliged to replace all of them when I'm back to 100% function?

I know leaving prayer with no regrets takes one out of the fold of Islam and I'm getting really anxious about the situation.",4,True,Question about Islam,question,0.86,False,Question about Islam

1geyoff,[Refuted] Does Islam permit marital rape? & Answer to Riyad as-Salihin 281,Substantial_Mess_456,2024-10-29 16:23:18+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1geyoff/refuted_does_islam_permit_marital_rape_answer_to/,127,/r/islam/comments/1geyoff/refuted_does_islam_permit_marital_rape_answer_to/,islam,"**This post is divided into two parts;**

1. Islam's condemnation of marital rape, and
2. Explanation of [Riyad as- Salihin 281](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:281), ""When a woman spends the night away from the bed of her husband, the angels curse her until morning...""

**Islam's condemnation of marital rape;**

There is a group of red pill men perpetuating this pernicious idea to all demographics and this notion has become undeservingly pervasive amongst Islam's attackers. 

This idea is no doubt internecine to islams image and it’s supposed treatment of women; so then, does Islam permit marital rape?

Imam Shafi’i said

>“Likewise, if he only has one wife or an additional servant with whom he has intercourse, he is commanded to fear Allah Almighty and to not harm her in regards to intercourse, although nothing specific is obligated upon him (ie in general with regards to intercourse anything that may cause harm to her is stringently forbidden for him, so no specifics are mentioned). He is only obligated to provide what benefits her such as financial maintenance, residence, clothing, and spending the night with her. As for intercourse, it’s position is one of pleasure and no one can be forced into it.” 

(al-Umm 5/203)

Al-Nawawi states as a general principle 

>“If it is possible to have intercourse with her without harming her, he may do that. If it is not possible for him to have intercourse with her except by harming her, then he does not have permission to have intercourse with her.” 

Al-Majmu Sharh al-Muhadhab 16/409 

This general statement is particularly interesting and extends more to just having sex with her without her consent. 

If having sex with her even consensually but you see that it is hurting her then it is forbidden for you to have sex with her. 

And of course no doubt that having sex against her lack of consent is clearly harmful to her, so it is of course forbidden to you in that regard. I simply wanted to evoke the idea that even if she consented and you having sex with her hurts her or harms her or whatnot, it is still forbidden for you.

Al-Buhuti said 

>“A husband has the right to enjoy his wife no matter the circumstance as long as he does not distract her from her religious obligations or harm her. He may not enjoy her in that case, since that is not living with them ‘honourably’ (4:19). If he does not distract her from her religious duties, and he does not harm her, then he may enjoy her.” 

Kashaaf al Qinaa’ (5/188) 

Of course, having sex with her against her lack of consent is clearly harming her, so it is NOT permissible for him in light of that.

>O you who believe, it is not lawful for you that you should forcibly take women as inheritance. Do not hold on to them so that you may take away some of what you have given them, unless they commit a clearly shameful act. Live with them in accordance with what is fair and kind. If you dislike them, then it is quite likely that you dislike something and Allah has placed a lot of good in it. (4:19) 

This is Quranic evidence for the good treatment of your wives and objection to this idea of marital rape being permitted.

not lawful for you to inherit women amongst their will nor .. is treating your wives harshly.. live with them in accordance to what is kind and fair and if you dislike them it may well be you dislike something in which god has put much good.

**Explanation of** [**Riyad as- Salihin 281**](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:281)**, ""When a woman spends the night away from the bed of her husband, the angels curse her until morning...""**

>As for the following Ahadeeth: Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم (said, ""When a man calls his wife to his bed, and she does not respond and he (the husband) spends the night angry with her, the angels curse her until morning"". \[Al-Bukhari and Muslim\]. 

>In another narration: The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم (said, ""When a woman spends the night away from the bed of her husband, the angels curse her until morning"". \[Al-Bukhari and Muslim\]. 

>In another narration: Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم (said, ""By Him in Whose Hand is my life, when a man calls his wife to his bed, and she does not respond, the One Who is above the heaven becomes displeased with her until he (her husband) becomes pleased with her"". \[Al-Bukhari and Muslim\]

This is taken heavily out of context. This Hadith is in reference to the women who weaponise sexual relations with her husband as a means to an end, because she wants to harm him or get back at him, as examples. Denying him sex for reasons external to Islamic validity falls under this weaponisation; can she deny him because she’s tired? Yes. Because she’s ill? Yes. Etc.

Two other narrations offer some vital details: the first has the wording ‘hājiratan firāsha zawjihā’ and the second has the wording ‘taʾbā ʿalayh’ (Bukhari and Muslim). 

One of these reports is Muslim 1436 which encapsulates the first phrase:

""‏ إِذَا بَاتَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ **هَاجِرَةً فِرَاشَ زَوْجِهَا** لَعَنَتْهَا الْمَلاَئِكَةُ حَتَّى تُصْبِحَ ‏""‏

The former wording has a nuance of her **deliberately avoiding the marital bed** – almost as though she **leaves it maliciously** and moves to another distant place; and the latter wording indicates **that she refused without due cause.**

Imam An Nawawi explains in his Sharh of this Hadeeth in Minhaaj: 

>“This is the daleel on the impermissibility of her refusing him without any Shar’i reason / excuse

In Awn al Ma’bud, the Sharh of the Hadeeth in Sunan Abi Dawud, it states:

>""She did not come to him without any Shar’i reason / excuse.”

In essence, this refers to the situation where she will deny the husband the outlet for his physical urges **in order to hurt him or to manipulate a situation to her end.** This places strain on the marriage, and could lead to his looking elsewhere to fulfill his needs, thereby defeating the purpose of trying to protect himself through marriage. Oftentimes, people who fall into extra-marital relationships do so because of complications within their marriage, and their emotional and physical needs push them along a regrettable path.

Consider the scenario : you get into an argument with your wife, and she says oh you’re not getting anything for the next 10 days; she is not allowed to do this. This is weaponising sex as a means to get back at the husband. Of course a woman is allowed to deny sex due to valid reasons, same with a husband. It is in both of their rights that they should be able to enjoy each other unless they have valid reasons to refuse it. For a woman to deny her husband without valid reason, as well as denying his rights, as well as manipulating his patience for sexual intercourse (Ibn Hajar - Fath-ul Bari 9/206) for no reason, this is weaponising sex

But as per the Quranic ayah *'treating them and bestowing them and embracing them with this intimate kindness and goodness and fairness and rectitude'*.. you cannot force yourself on her and this is absolutely forbidden for you. 

Ibn Hajar in his commentary of this Hadith explains 

>“As for the tradition on this topic, there is nothing in it but that the angels do that (cursing). It does not necessitate for him permission in any respect. 

Fath al Bari 4897

In this very specific situation, the wife refuses to answer her husband’s request to join him in bed. **She does not have a valid excuse to refuse him such as being preoccupied or ill or tired. Rather, she refuses him out of a mean-spirited attitude only.** This is a violation of the terms of the marriage contract and therefore a sin, and it might also tempt the husband to satisfy his natural impulse in an unlawful manner. If the husband spends the entire night in his house angry with her or hurt by her, it causes the angels to curse her until the morning.

The Prophet warns such women of the negative moral consequences of this inexplicable behavior, but he gives no concession to the husband to take his right by force. If forced sexual compliance was an acceptable option, we could reasonably infer that the Prophet would have mentioned it here but he did not. Hence, the tradition is an implicit proof against marital rape and, by analogy, against the rape of concubines as well.

Such is the moral rectitude instilled in this relationship by Allah who has ordained it between a man and a woman. May Allah obliterate those who pervade this harmful notion and who delude the attackers of Islam giving them fuel for their hysterical fires.",17,True,Scholarly Resource,article,0.9,False,Scholarly Resource

Not only I’m the only Muslim in the family, but all my relatives are religious Hindus. I remember being a hidden Christian once, and once my father had suspicions, he gave me threats like “you won’t be my son anymore”, “your relatives won’t talk to you anymore” and even “I’ll be so heartbroken I will have a heart attack and die”. He obviously says these things in hopes to emotionally manipulate me away from other religions, but I always fear if that could actually happen because I love my family. If that is his response to me being Christian, his response to me being Muslim would be 10x worse.

I usually go to India twice a year. I haven’t visited India as a Muslim yet, but when I do, things will get so much harder. It will be harder praying 5 times a day and keeping my imaan strong. Since Muslims are pretty much a minority and Islamophobia is still growing, it makes me really afraid of going to India, especially surrounded by my Hindu family 24/7. If they find out in India, I’m actually gone. Hell, I might even get killed by my father’s brother who a Hindu nationalist that contributed to a demolition of a mosque in the 1980s. 

I don’t even have any Muslim friends or even any friend to help me, so I’m just fending for myself. I plan on telling them when I’m financially dependent, but if they know earlier and they actually cut me off, idk where to go, idk who to ask for help, idk who to look up to. If I’m in India, the best I can do is Dhikr. 

Please help me and make dua. I need guidance. At least help me get some Muslim friends to guide me through these type of problems.",25,True,Seeking Support,discussion,0.95,False,Seeking Support

I am a Shia Muslim. I live in Iraq and born to a Shia Muslim family. I have been a Shia Muslim throughout my life. And my friend, who was a Sunni that I met three years ago, started telling me that I'm gonna go to hellfire if I don't become a Sunni. And when I said I'm a Shia, I'm not the kind of Shia you might expect. I do not say Ya Ali, Ya Zaynab or Ya Hussain. I only say Ya Allah. I don't curse the wives of the Prophet. I don't curse the friends of the Prophet. I actually love most of them. And the friends of the Prophet or the companions of the Prophet that Shias mostly hate, I do not engage with any conversation about them. So whenever they talk about Abu Bakr or Omar bin Khattab, I just say, I don't know. Allahu A'alam. I'm also good to my mother (my father left). And I do fasting. And I love all the Muslim community, Sunnis and most Shias. It's just I don't want to get involved with all this books and all this stuff that is really complicated. But at the same time, I had just had some infidelic kind of thoughts when my friend told me I will go to hellfire despite me being deeply religious. I pray every salah. I do everything that is right just to please Allah. But in the end, I will go to hellfire?! That really seemed like really unfair. Why would the all-merciful God throw me in hellfire just because I didn't believe in most stuff Sunni believe?. He said that my Salah isn't correct btw. Like I said, I do not say Ya Ali. I do not say Ya Hussain. I don't even do latum or tatbeer. I don't believe that the qur'an is muharaf. I don't do anything haram. I don't believe in most of the Shia stuff. So what do you guys think?

It’s been really hard, and I find myself constantly checking his social media to see if he’s sent me anything, which only makes it harder to move on.

I know this decision is for the best, but I’m having a tough time staying strong and not slipping back into old habits. I would really appreciate any advice on how to cope with these feelings and how to stop myself from checking his socials. I’m trying to stay focused on my deen and grow in my faith, but some days are more challenging than others.

Please don’t judge me. I’m young, still learning, and just need some support from those who understand what it feels like to go through something like this.

So recently I've been really trying my best to keep up with salah but sadly I sometimes miss some salahs or a whole day of salahs due to bad habits, laziness, or procrastination.

It led me to realize how many salahs I've missed since I skipped so many days thinking I would ""start over perfectly"" the next day. Now I know I have to perform these salahs but I have no idea how to count them, and if I could, I don't think I am able to do all of them since I'm so lazy, like I can't do my normal daily 5 prayers in their time so how am I supposed to make up for all these as a moqasir? 

And contrary to what it sounds like, I feel very close to allah, I'm always thinking of him, always fearing him, always doing istighfar yet I cannot perform the duties he ordered me to do, which is disappointing of me.

All of that led me to just full on believe I'm going to hell, like alhamdulilah I believe I do a lot of good in my life but recently it's been feeling like the good that I'm doing has no value or meaning if I'm missing my salahs,
and now I'm living with a fear of going to hell.
Sometimes I have these moments of ""either way you're going to hell so, it doesn't really matter does it?"". I'm starting to be convinced that I'm going to hell since it's my salah that'll save me from it, and I'm not performing it well. I know all of this is shaytan's doing but I'm still struggling honestly and it's been affecting me recently. 

I know allah is the most merciful, but I have this wrong belief that it's only for sins which I think won't be enough if I don't do my salahs.

Now I don't know what to say or what help to ask for, but any form of advice or comment would really help :)",6,True,Question about Islam,question,1.0,False,Question about Islam

I have always been pretty religious and relationships were not even on my ideas, i dont know how i felled into this trap.
he was really manipulative, mentally and emotionally abusive with me, he had absolute control on me and i was like his puppet. Really bad effects started to appear on myself, like depression, eating disorders etc. I wasnt happy with him but it seemed impossible for me to live without him. Also i was seeing him everyday because we were in the same class at school. I live in france so school end in june and start again in september.Now a new school year has started, and he is in my class again, when i saw him the first day, i thought i was going to faint, i wanted to di.e because i said to myself that being again in the same class as him was like hell. He started to harass me during the three first weeks of september because he wanted to be with me again but i didnt cause i couldnt take this anymore, now he stopped texting, calling and harrassing me at school. But he have managed to make everybody of our class to not talk to me anymore. To isolate me, so that if he can’t have me, nobody else could. 
I have done really bad things with this boy. I regret it so much, i have already asked many times to Allah to forgive me, i dont know if he did. But one thing is sure, is that i cant forgive myself for this sin i have commited. Wallahi im so ashamed of myself, i make nightmares about him every night, all of the day im so sad and angry and i can’t forgive myself.

This has made me very curious about how Muslims serve God, and how it differs from Christians.

Does this mean that while Muslims consider God to be their creator, they don't see him as an ""acting"" father? Does this idea of ​​saying that they are God's servants rather than God's children differ greatly in their relationship with God compared to Christians, or is it just the name that is different but the human/God relationship remains the same as Christians ?

I'm not sure what to believe, because on one hand, Allāh (SWT) has demonstrated in His divine revelation that He (SWT) can show things such as love and anger, but on the other hand, emotions are a very animalistic attribute that only humans and animals carry, and we know Allāh (SWT) is unlike his creations, so which one is true?

i am very interested in other religions and cultures and would like to understand Islam better. However after some research some issues occured and I would like to have some advise on them:

1.) What translation should I use? When people talk about Islam, especially when someone critisizes it, I often hear the argument akin to ""This is a mistranslation etc."". I'd like to avoid such situations, but I am not an Arabic speaker and cannot assess the quality of a translation. And if multiple are fine, which one should I at least avoid? And what other tips do you have to avoid the mistranslation-issue.

2.) I'd like to moderately learn about Islam, that means i'm definetly down to get into Hadiths and Tafsir, but the canon is pretty vast. What resources and pensum would you recommend that is neither too much nor too little? 

3.) Is there a proper course on Islam in general? (for explainations on the basics like the 5 pillars, how praying works, what holidays there are in a year etc.)

4.) What are good teachers on Islam? When I talked with Muslims in the past, different people said to different teachers that they are false and preaching a wrong Islam. Which Imams are in general well regarded? Maybe also from different branches to get a feeling for the differences (for example between Sunni and Shia).

5.) Would it be inappropriate to take notes or mark sentences in the Quran i'll get?

6.) In which order should I read the Quran? From front to back or in chronological order?

My scope is to be able to have a good understanding of my Muslim countrymen, learning itself (Islam is interesting in itself ^^) and avoid mischaracterisations of both left- and right-leaning people, which seem to be prevalent in the west.

Thank you very much!",4,True,Question about Islam,question,1.0,False,Question about Islam

Should I wear a headscarf/hijab?

What type of clothes should I have?

When I enter the masjid, do I have to do something to show my respect or gratitude (I was raised Catholic, and when we enter the church, we had to do the cross symbol on us with a bit of holy water, I'm not sure if there's something similar with other religions!)??

1.) Will things from Earth be in Jannah? For example convineces we have today like cars and large houses.

2.) Do we still need to pray Salah there?

3.) It is said that the realm of the lowest person in Jannah will be 50x larger than the empire of the greatest king on Earth. Is that just vast uninhabited land with nothing on it? Because as great as it sounds, it seems lonely. What are you going to do with 50 Earths? I know this question might sound really stupid but it just keeps coming to mind.

I am really worried. I thought the big signs of Judegment day are going to start after 60-100 years from now and I thought I would have time to enjoy life (in halal way of couse).

I wanted to buy a bunch of cars (cars is my guilty pleasure) and of course also donate to the poor to keep things balanced. 



But now I am like whats the point? whats the point of going to university. I get my degree and get the cars while the world is on fire. why study? why be a doctor or engineer or businessman when a few years down the line we will be in famine starving for food. I thought we have 1-4 more generations until this would happen but now I am like maybe this might happen in my generation. I had so much plans and dreams and now I look at the world and I feel everyone is living a fantasy and are oblivious about the shit thats about to happen.

salam brothers and sisters, i’ll get straight to it. i’ve been having moments of anxiety since year 7 but only a regular amount ( eg. before meeting up with someone for the first time, going up on a stage or before a speech) but the physical symptoms would go away after the situation has passed. in december of last year i got into an argument with someone and broke down because of what they said. i’ve cried many times before this but this panic attack was unbearable to the point i was convinced that i was gonna die. when the paramedics arrived , the female paramedic who was also muslim said to me “nice girl nice hair” but she didn’t say mashallah. 10 months later, the physical symptoms i experienced that night are still persistent every single day and this is what i experience : 

- shortness of breath ( feeling like i can’t take a full breath ) 
- limbs feeling like jelly or a ‘dizzy’ feeling in my arms 
- feeling like the blood in my limbs is cold 
- pins and needles + numbness in legs and arms 
- tense muscles 
- constant medical issues then the doctors say “ there’s nothing wrong with you”
- extreme fatigue
- extreme dizziness / always lightheaded 
- excessively crying for no reason 
- heart palpitations + heart flutters 
- chest and stomach tightness, like my chest is closing in on itself 
- abdominal cramps 
- uncontrollably shaking all the time involuntarily for no reason + getting shivers/ shaking inside of my body or bloodstream? it’s hard to explain but it’s basically like shaking on the outside but it’s inside of your body. 
- headaches ( especially on the left side of my head ) 
- nausea 
- random green/bluish bruises on my body that show up every single week or every 2 weeks even though i havent hurt my body on anything and it doesn’t hurt 
- yawning a lot when praying or reciting surahs ( yawning doesn’t happen before then unless i’m super tired) 
- negative thoughts 
- head pressure 
- sweating and urinating a lot 
- shoulder and lower back pain 
- mental fog, unable to concentrate
- urge to always sleep 
- becoming extremely pale 
- not feeling like going out 
- fear of death 
- tendency to cry when listening to ruqayah + quran ( even though i don’t understand arabic ) and sometimes getting irritated when someone plays the quran 
- throat tightness 
- urge to turn off any ruqayah video after i cry for no reason 
- always itching my legs and arms so much to the point it bleeds and leaves a semi permanent scar 
- always feeling extremely hot within my body or like i’m breathing in hot air
- sneezing a lot 
- developing random fears 
- feeling like i’m losing oxygen in my head and getting dizzy after i talk or laugh 
- tingling in my brain like little cramps 
- body always sore for no reason 

i went to many doctors and they all said it’s anxiety but i’ve had worse panic attacks than what i experienced and the physical symptoms were gone after a day. alhamdulillah and i say this genuinely from the bottom of my heart , i have no problems other than this ‘sickness’ i’m experiencing. all the doctors said “ you have to find the deeply rooted issue that’s causing this anxiety” but i genuinely do not know and feel like its possibly bigger than anxiety??? ever single fear, act of shaking, excessively crying and heart palpitations occur for no reason AT ALL. i genuinely cant say what i’m anxious about to feel this way but it’s just something in me making me scared. these symptoms also happen when i’m happy. i’ve taken lexapro and seratline ( medicine for anxiety ) and nothing has worked, even when increasing the dose. took a blood test and everything came back good ( only my iron was low but i’m taking medication for that ). no thyroid issues, no heart issues ( confirmed by a cardiologist) i don’t have pneumonia or anything alhamdulillah, im 19 and clean from anything harmful. 

sorry if this was a medical sort of rant, i just need to know if it’s possibly anxiety or evil eye because it hasn’t gone after 10 months and no matter what i do ( breathing exercises, sleeping, reciting dua, getting off my phone), the physical symptoms don’t go away or become manageable. i have no reason to go and see someone professional because like i said, i don’t have big problems. my mother also tried reciting ruqayah on me when this first happened after i came back from the hospital and i didn’t let her, i shut her down from anger. this happened immediately after i prayed tahajjud so i’m extremely confused, thanks.

He mentioned a Hadith that was something to do with (and I do not want to speak wrongly of the Prophet, peace be upon him, so this is just a rough guess at what I remember the video saying) how Aisha had some dates that were either covered in something (maybe a bag) and she kept eating from them. But she realised a long time had passed and she still had dates left, so she decided to look and saw that there were only a few dates left. I think she might have brought this up to the Prophet peace be upon him and said something about how if she had not looked, it would have provided for her until the Hour or Day of Judgement.

I reverted to Islam in August this year and I was gaining so much support from the Islamic community. However, I was misled by the sheikh/business partner that was guiding me.  

First scenario he lied to me that I can be Christian and Muslim at the same time which you guys told me it's not true. He always wanted me to bump my head and find answers by myself which ends me in getting humiliated. So I resorted to Reddit because I felt safe, luckily you guys encouraged me to do more research and even gave me hadiths which made me fall in love with the religion and made me believe it's the truth so I willingly took on the shahadah. He gave me the name Shireen because he made me feel like I did damage as a Christian so I took the offer to change my name in a heartbeat but he never wanted me to tell my family (he believes cutting them off is best if you want success).

 Second scenario he forced me to wear hijab telling me I shouldn't be seen by people (not teaching me about modesty and most women who wear hijabs in Zimbabwe are married). I would wear it every day but I started hearing rumours that we got married. Which is funny because he never wanted me to have any relations with people with ""fixed mindsets"", which are all my friends. 

Third, he called me a sahaba, which made you guys angry and I ended up getting death threats that led me to take a break from Reddit. 

Fourth, he made me disobey my Christian family and run away from home (i didn't want to fight with my family, I just needed a break, I was being overworked being a caterer being forced to learn habits of Elon Musk and other high performers), where during that process I was deprived of food and sleep and all I wanted to do was bath and tell my grandfather that I needed a break but the sheikh made me fight with him instead. Later on, my phone got stolen, I ended up by my aunt's house who I fought with, I was weak and losing my voice and nobody listened to me. They took me to the hospital where I had a mental breakdown and they injected me and I woke up in a Christian rehab facility where I suffocated spiritually. They refused to let me have the quran and they kept injecting me every time I made a complaint and they even provoked me when I had my monthly. My father got me out of there mashaalah but weeks I felt betrayed by my family.

 Lastly, he created a fake invitation from a very important Mulana to invite me to a reformation program because he believed that I had a veil over my face. That's where I drew the line. As a business partner he sold me dreams and I gained too much power that was snatched right away from me because I almost broke ties with my family. My name was tainted as a psychotic person, I'm not psychotic, I have rights that keep getting violated.

 But don't worry, I haven't lost faith in Islam but for now I don't wear the hijab as much as I used to, I plan on getting an abaya and wearing it properly dressed. It took me research to know that the clothes I was wearing were not hijab friendly i feel like the lunatic that people claim I am.

[Commentary]

“Allah has not made anything forbidden except that He knew that someone from among you would commit it,” means that Allah has prohibited some actions, but because He is the most knowledgeable, He knows that some people will be tempted and commit the sin. These prohibited actions are harmful, in this world or the next or even both; Allah knows best, so He has forbidden some things for us as they are bad for us. 

“Verily, I am holding onto you to prevent you from falling into the Fire, just as moths or flies fall into it.” The meaning is that the Prophet ﷺ describes his role in trying to prevent us from going to hell. “Just as moths or flies fall into it.” This, subhanallah, is such a wise statement and among the beautiful examples the Prophet ﷺ gave. Moths and flies are insects that typically are attracted to light, so if someone has a torch or light, they will most likely follow it. The Prophet ﷺ says that he is holding the people back by warning us against the sins, and the like. So flies and moths, as they are attracted to light, if they see fire, for example, they see light so they will most likely fall into it. Similarly, people often see sins as something desirable or good, so without thinking about their dangers, they fall into them, like moths and flies that see light but actually fall into fire. So the Prophet ﷺ is trying to prevent us from falling into the fire; he’s trying to stop us from following our desires and committing sins that seem desirable by reminding us of the consequences in the Hereafter! 

And Allah Knows Best.

1ge2nc3,Concerned About Animal Treatment in halal slaughterhouses. Thoughts? Scholar Recommendations?,Used-Distribution968,2024-10-28 13:55:44+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1ge2nc3/concerned_about_animal_treatment_in_halal/,18,/r/islam/comments/1ge2nc3/concerned_about_animal_treatment_in_halal/,islam,"Assalamualaikum,

I recently watched some footage of a halal slaughterhouse, and honestly, it left me feeling disturbed. The way the animals were handled—dragged, thrown around, and visibly distressed—seemed at odds with Islamic teachings on mercy and kindness.

A few things really got to me: 

Sheep were dragged by limbs, punched, and generally treated like objects instead of the living beings they are.

The place was noisy, crowded, and bloody, which visibly added to the animals’ fear and stress. You could tell from the video they know nothing good is going on beyond those walls and they were in obvious distress and avoidance of that area, compounding the force and violence needed to get them to go there.

Doing this every day—can people even stay compassionate enough to treat the animals right, or does it desensitize them?

This has me questioning if large-scale slaughter can truly align with the care Islam requires for animals. Also, given that meat is way more accessible now than it was in the past, should we maybe rethink how much we consume?

I can't share the footage because it's undercover footage and I am not allowed to share it right now (I can share it in the future), but suffice it to say it's no different from footage you would see in a ""western"" slaughterhouse in a documentary like earthlings. Really the only difference is that there is Quran playing in the background. I could not even discern the person with the knife saying anything. At many points you can even see the workers mocking the sheep with demeaning things while punching them through conveyor belts.

I'd also appreciate if you have sources dedicated to animal rights in islam, or know of scholars who are outspoken about this I could reach out to.",15,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.95,False,General Discussion
1gen0os, A Majestic Parable of Creation and Purpose,Able-Garage2837,2024-10-29 05:05:36+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1gen0os/a_majestic_parable_of_creation_and_purpose/,1,/r/islam/comments/1gen0os/a_majestic_parable_of_creation_and_purpose/,islam,"Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, a distinguished Turkish scholar, devoted his life to spreading the message of the Quran and strengthening the faith of believers, even in the face of great adversity. His journey was marked by trials, especially during the Ottoman Empire's decline and the rise of secular forces intent on erasing Islamic values. Despite imprisonment and exile, Nursi remained unshaken, placing his unwavering trust in Allah. His magnum opus, *Risale-i Nur*, continues to illuminate hearts, offering divine wisdom and guidance.

In one of his reflections, Nursi compares Allah’s creation to a grand palace, expressing that just as every person of beauty and perfection desires their qualities to be appreciated, so does the Divine King. Allah created the world as a showcase of His unmatched artistry, power, and knowledge. He built an extraordinary palace adorned with rare jewels and intricate designs, so every corner reflects His craftsmanship and wisdom.

The king (Allah, exalted be He) wished to see and be seen from two perspectives:

1. **First:** That He Himself may view His creations and artistry.
2. **Second:** That His creation might witness, admire, and understand His grandeur and beauty.

To fulfill this purpose, Allah adorned His palace with incomparable beauty, every corner holding precious jewels, rare designs, and signs of His infinite artistry. Each design, each element of beauty, served as a testament to His omnipotence. The entire palace reflected not just outward beauty but also deep, timeless truths meant to inspire awe in anyone who saw it. When this magnificent creation was complete, Allah arranged an extravagant banquet, filling the palace with delightful provisions and blessings to welcome every being into His kingdom of wonders.

To ensure understanding, Allah appointed a special guide—the noblest messenger, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ—who would teach the guests about the palace, its designs, and the wisdom embedded within. The guide explained that everything in the palace held a deeper purpose, each jewel a lesson in divine wisdom. He revealed that these signs were not mere decorations but messages from Allah, inviting us to recognize His infinite attributes.

Two groups emerged from this scene:

1. **The First Group** consisted of those wise enough to appreciate the divine order of the palace. When they saw its magnificence, they were filled with gratitude and sought to understand its purpose. They recognized the guide’s wisdom, accepted his teachings, and observed the palace with reverence. The king, pleased with their humility and respect, invited them to even greater blessings, rewarding them with a life of honor and everlasting peace.
2. **The Second Group** were those who ignored the guide’s wisdom and instead indulged themselves mindlessly in the palace’s pleasures. They turned a blind eye to the grandeur surrounding them and neglected the guide’s invitation to contemplate. As they indulged recklessly, they dishonored the king’s laws and were eventually cast out by his guards, punished for their disregard.

O dear friend, this palace is none other than the universe itself, with its celestial ceiling filled with stars and a floor blossoming with life. The King is our Creator, Al-Malik, who controls day and night and whose governance is reflected in every element of existence. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the guide appointed to show us the way to our Creator, the One who leads us to the ultimate truths within this world and the hereafter.

In the words of the Quran:

>

>

Let us, then, reflect upon this palace of creation, following the Prophet’s ﷺ guidance, and understand that every blessing we see is an invitation to witness Allah's infinite beauty. To see the world with open hearts, as those of the first group did, is to unlock an endless ocean of wisdom and gratitude.",4,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.67,False,General Discussion

I have this questions of doing instinja because I really never had someone explain them to me while I was younger. And you woudn't know how big of help it'd be if you point me in the right direction. I created a reddit account just to ask you guys.

For those of you who have used squat toilets (which have the hole on the floor instead of in the seat), how do you exactly clean with water (front and back) without impure water splashing back to your feet, because I feel like impure water hits the floor then splashes back on my feet. I really don't know how to avoid that.

Also, in the case of seat toilets, when you use a bidet for example to clean, do you not feel like impure water would hit the bottom of toilet then splashes back on your skin.

Please, if it's possible, a detailed answer is very appreciated since I looked for answers in the sub but a lot of the times, I don't understand the process easily.

To be sincere with you, what I do is that I take a shower after each nr. 2 and it would be easier for me if I could do only instinja.

But if a woman covers more conservatively, she automatically receives less attention. The same is true for men.

This is the beauty of Islam, it puts the onus of attraction on both the genders. And before anybody comes at me, i also advocate for men dressing very conservatively (for instance, wear jubba/thobe as much as possible, wear loose full sleeve shirts and extremely loose trousers that don't reveal body shape, button the shirt all the way up, wear socks etc.) 'Cause believe it or not, women have desires too, and so the onus  lies on men too to protect their own awrah.

Secondly, as Muslims, God specifically commands us to enjoin good and forbid evil. Hence, even without the extreme jealousy thing, it must be a priority to ensure that our family is dressed appropriately. Forcing them to don the hijab is definitely not the way to go, but constantly reminding them is necessary. (Note, even the Qur'an is essentially a ""REMINDER""). If we don't do that, we shall end up denying Allah's command. 

It's also important to take note of the fact that if a man wants his wife to dress conservatively, he must also do that himself and lead by example. Because he is a afterall the patriarch and leader of the household. And the leader must lead by example. A man should NOT wear shorts and body hugging half sleeves and expect his wife to wear a niqab. Thus it becomes necessary to gauge mental and religious compatibility before marriage.",15,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.6,False,General Discussion

Recently, she started showing interest in me, and although I initially ignored the signs, we eventually talked about it.

I explained that I’m Muslim and didn’t want to pursue anything further. We had a long conversation about Islam, and she was genuinely interested, despite being from a Jewish household and identifying as an atheist. After some time apart, she reached out about her acceptance to my current university, and I felt a strong attachment forming.

Confessing, I enjoyed our connection but realized I had to stop things before they got too serious. I made it clear I didn't want her to convert for me, but she expressed a desire to learn more about Islam. However, she's worried about her parents' negative views and the cultural implications of converting.

When I spoke to my dad about the possibility of marrying her if she converts, he was firmly against it, wanting me to marry within our culture. I believe that if she genuinely embraces Islam, she could be more committed than some born Muslims.

I converted to Islam in February, alhamdulillah, and since then, I’ve been trying to align my life more closely with our beautiful faith. However, I have struggled with a terrible nicotine addiction that started before my conversion. Recently, I’ve been getting really nauseous whenever I use my nicotine pouches, and I’m starting to feel that maybe this is a sign from Allah to finally quit.

I’m posting here to ask for guidance on how I can break free from this addiction in a way that’s pleasing to Allah. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear about what helped you. Are there any duas I can make, specific steps I should take, or any Islamic advice that can strengthen my resolve?

I truly want to quit and live a healthier life, insha’Allah, but I feel like I need extra help and strength to get there.

AKA disbelieving in Allah SWT. As for suicide, so many of the rulings online (based on Abu Hurayrah) say that one who suicides is threatened with the punishment of hellfire for eternity*. Which means unlike other sins where if you are not forgiven, if you are muslim, you will experience hellfire for some time until you are forgiven. So that makes it an unforgivable sin? I’m very confused on this topic and have not been able to find a straight answer. Jazakum Allahu Khairan.

I guess it must be difficult to translate and adapt the Arab semantics to my language and probably that makes it lose part of the message and its beauty. I have always heard Quran is written in a very delicate and beautiful manner, but in the translation I get nothing from that.

This post is short and brief, but I want Muslims who aren’t educated on Judaism and Christianity to know that even in their beliefs they had an established Qiblah in the past. you can simply remind them of this fact if you ever run into the situation.

Two instances that I would recommend you research are Solomon praying towards the temple in Jerusalem and the Ark of the Covenant 

Where the Ark of the Covenant was quite literally an object that was carried around and prayed towards in the OT


No Christian would throw objection to these since they are found in the Bible, but make sure to remind them of the double standards they might be applying when it comes to Islam 

Especially when we see the Kaaba as nothing more than a building

Last night i had this very realistic dream where i suddenly started wearing a hijab for the first time. I’m sure it was a Hijab because i remember there being a woman who showed me how to wear it. In the same dream my family was giving me to marry a muslim man. The woman who i mentioned teaching me how to wear a Hijab was the mother of the man i was supposed to marry.

But when life starts better, you regret failing to stay silent with your negative thoughts.

Does that mean you have missed the reward of sabr, or is there a way to still gain it post-hoc?

For example, for me, its a disease of the heart that rears its head every 3 mins - voices constantly saying ""7 years of my life were wasted pursuing this field, only to learn that merit and hard work don't mean anything, He will just give it to the undeserving etc. If I had just not tried very hard, and just been incompetent, He also would have given me success earlier on too, etc"". These thoughts divulge into worse and eat away at me and have reduced my character to one of jealousy, anger, and all the other qualities of Iblees. Even if I manage to control these thoughts and not verbalize them, could I somehow still gain the reward of sabr if I didn't display it throughout the whole time?

**Simple Analogy:** Lets say someone is in Prophet Yusuf or Prophet Ayub's place, but throughout the time in prison/hardship, this person verbalizes ingratitude, and further ruins their situation, but near the end of this period, regains his Imaan, character, and acceptance of Allah's Qadr, would he still be rewarded for the full length of the hardship? Or are those earlier years lost?

There are a few questions that I have: 

1. If my family goes out to temples and such places and I’m forced to tag along, even if I don’t participate in anything and stay away from idols but will my mere presence in those places count as a sin/shirk? 

2. I couldn’t get a straightforward answer to this on google but since my father is dead, can I still pray for him to be forgiven? What kind of Dua can I make for him? Or if I make charity in his name, will that help him during judgement day? 

3. Does me having anxiety and fear about the future make me a bad Muslim? 

4. How can I say Inshallah during conversations with my family or non Muslims? Is it okay if I say “god willing” 

5. I get interrupted during Salah sometimes because I hide and I pray and sometimes I can’t complete the prayer and have to wait until evening Maghrib/Isha time to make up for asr. Are my prayers still valid and accepted? 

6. I’ve stopped listening to music completely but I sometimes hum on accident and sometimes have songs stuck in my head and I say astaghfirullah and try to replace it with a ayat but is me humming and having a song stuck in my head bad? 

7. Since I do not have my father with me anymore and my brother isn’t Muslim, how exactly would I get married? Would I have to speak to an imam or who exactly would play as my guardian in this case?

I think watching videos of lectures by someone like Omar Suleiman would be the best way to delve into learning about Islam before reading the Quran. 

I do not think that beginning by reading the Quran would be the most efficient way. I think it may get confusing without *some* deeper knowledge of Islam other than the basics (who was the Prophet, what are the 5 pillars, etc). I am Arab, born into Islam, grew up in a pretty religious household, speak and read Arabic and even I have trouble sometimes with understanding the Quran. 

Can anyone suggest videos, lectures, etc by scholars like Omar Suleiman that I can forward to this person at this stage? ",6,True,Seeking Support,discussion,0.75,False,Seeking Support

Basically early last year my dad had to go on dialysis after a health scare and it was the hardest time of my life but he got better after a few months, definitely not 100 percent but could still laugh, watch movies, he could come upstairs and still hold a conversation with me. Fast forward to October 2024. He was in and out of the hospital for a few months until they altered a few things and than he’s been at home for over a month with only spending one day at the hospital to drain fluid so he can breathe better. But recently he seems the weakest he’s ever been. He’s hunched over a lot, walks slow, doesn’t really understand much, can’t really hold a conversation with him, only things I can do are hug him and kiss him and I’m grateful for that but recently I’ve started to become bitter seeing how he is now and remembering how good he was less than 2 years ago. I’m only 23 by the way. Today he was sat down on the bathroom floor because he couldn’t stand up from the toilet and my mom called me to help and he had poop on his foot and was wearing a diaper. I was grossed out just seeing my dad like this, I literally just helped him up and left and my mom did the rest. She cut her hand on something and I said that’s what you get for being so damn nervous all the time, she’s been doing this thing recently where everything she does, she does as if she’s in a race, I’m sure the stress has messed with her nervous system but it irritates the living hell out of me and makes my blood boil because it makes me nervous too and messes with my perception of reality. I’m letting her deal with everything and almost not caring at all because I’m so bitter and angry that this is my life now, seeing my dad like this feels like it’s taking apart of my soul. I’m starting to just not care about a single damn thing and than I’m like my mom loves me so much and has went through hell for me and now I’m literally letting her deal with everything and not helping at all because I just can’t deal with the fact my dad is like this and I’m only 23. Even just checking on him when he’s asleep makes me feel like I’m looking at a corpse because he looks so weak. It’s starting to give me existential crises and I’m dealing with depersonalization so just everything is turning me into a bitter and soulless person.

I was honestly impressed with how good his drawing skills became. Curious about others' opinions I went to reddit to see what are others thoughts.

The first post I found was from a guy complaining about how PewDiePie's drawing skills were miles better than his, even though he (the OP of the post) had been drawing for much longer. His post felt filled with jealousy and envy and also self hate.

I visited his account curios of his drawing skills saying that he can't be that bad at drawing, only to find that he’s a young LGBT+ ex-Muslim living in a Muslim country who struggles with suicidal thoughts and mental health issues. More than half of his posts were anti-Islamic, attacking Islam and Muslims, and maybe that’s part of the reason he has these issues in the first place. From the envy to the suicidal thoughts, and the LGBT-related confusion, that is destroying his mental health because he is trying to become somthing he isn't a Female (Interestingly, he linked a channel of someone who had become an ex-Muslim asking others to support him, I opened the link and the ex Muslim we supposed to support was just announcing his his toabah. quite ironic right ?)

We're of a similar age and have similar interests, and we live in similar societies(Muslim societies). The main difference is that I am a Muslim. I don't envy others for being better than me, I’m mentally stable, and I don’t have thoughts of ending my life. I’m at peace with who I am, and I thank Islam for providing me with the guidance I need.

Honestly, I feel sad for him. I hope he finds his way back to the right path and makes positive changes in his life because it’s never too late.

I am so disappointed in myself and i regret what ive done but before explaining i want to give some context about my mom

She lost her mom when she was a baby (6 months), her stepmother mistreated her and manipulated her dad to think that his kids were worthless (it worked, she didn't have any love and her childhood sucked). She married my dad who is a selfish and heartless man ( his childhood was horrible also, his brothers mistreated him horribly and his family is evil). He emotionally abused my mom for 17 years by saying horrible things to her, mistreating her and humiliating her. He always complains about money although al hamdoulilah we live a decent life, he gives nothing to my mom. My mom has to look and sell used things to get some money or save some because my dad gives he nothing. Life has been so unfair to her and me and my brothers are the last thing that keeps her not falling insane or in depression. Our family all suck, i never met any of my grandparents because they all died except the one from my mom's side but he doesn't care about my mom.

My is a very sweet person who would help anyone in need, I've skipped a lot of details because it would be a book otherwise. Her heart got broken multiple times and her kindness got exploited by strangers and our own family.

I promised me and my siblings that we would help her get out of her misery and help improving her life

But i feel like I act like a hypocrite sometimes like for example today, she wanted to go outside to buy something and asked me nicely to come with her ( i really didn't feel like it but i knew she was going to force me a little bit so i got a little mad which was so stupid). We argued and she stopped talking and we went to our car. I tried to excuse myself and say sorry because i realized how dumb and stupid i was and she just said ""Stop"", ""Don't dare saying you are going to help me in the future because i just asked you to go outside with me"", "" Thank you for making me realize how i should only rely on myself""

I want to cry now and I'm sad because I'm realizing that i might have acted like my dad

I hitted puberty at 9, unfortunately for me I have a lot of missed prayers, I don't know how many prayers I missed so I thought I'd made it up for the last 9 years if Allah allow me to live longly enough 

The problem is that there are different opinion on that, some says you can not make it up and others that says you should. 

I'm lost, but what is worst is that once I learnt about the first option I thought it would be possible to repent and move foward while asking for forgiveness and regret sincerely, but the problem is that I live in a secular country with their secular schools and I don't know the nearest masjid around my school so how can I make sincere repentance while knowing I missed principal point of the regret ? which is to never to miss prayer again. 

Because I know I'll have class next day, and the day after and I wont be able to pray on time... it's horrible. I can not do it hijrah (moving to a muslim country) because I'm still a beginner in arabic and there are a lot of personnal reasons that adds. 

Also the second option is quite stressful and difficult to realise, since I should make it up the missed prayers I make them up after coming home (because I can't during class or between...) all at once with the fatigue and stress of homeworks, it miss it's sense and I'm like ""argh there's still this prayer to make"" so I miss the mindest a muslim should have to be literally happy to pray on time.

I've had my heart set on this university for so long, but over the past year, I stopped praying altogether. Now, I’ve found myself praying again, hoping for Allah's help to get in. It feels selfish, though, like I only turn to Him when I have nowhere else to lean on, when I need a miracle only He can give. How can I come to terms with this guilt?

I wish I had stayed consistent in my prayers. Every time I ask for help, I promise I'll keep up with my faith if He guides me through, and He always does, but I rarely keep my end of that promise. It's overwhelming. I feel like I'm falling apart, that I’m a bad Muslim, and that He's disappointed with me this time, maybe even too disappointed to answer my prayers.

When I met my husband, I agreed to live with his parents, since it was his wish to be able to look after them. I agreed, although I always pictured my marriage differently, but it made me happy to know that I can help him be a good son and I respected him for that. Although I did everything for him and his parents, it never seemed to be enough. We even paid for everything. They would talk bad about me behind my back,interpret everything I did with a bad intention and just mistrust me completely. After years of headache, sleepless nights, chronic stress, therapy and countless fights with my husband and his family I asked Allah to help me make the right decision. A month after that my father got a phenomenal offer for us: two apartments, new, exceptional price, next ti each other so that we would have our own apartment and his parents would live next door. Never would I even have dreamed of that, as I didnt think it was possible with our financial situation (not that it was bad but I didnt know that we could sign two apartments together (4people)"". I told my husband and his parents and at first they were thrilled but after a week or two they all started to have their doubts and didnt trust it. Again I felt completely helpless, as I thought finally Allah sent me the perfect solution for our problem and my husband/his family are holding against it. For 7 months I tried to convince my husband that this was the only way for us, finding out what his doubts were and eliminating them. when I heard that my parents in law still thought I was after their money and this was all an ambush I finally decided that this would stop there. I told my husband and his parents that I would search for an apartment for myself and my husband if he wanted to join me. if not, that that was okay for me and would not stop me. 2.5 months later I signed the contract for another apartment and moved in two weeks later with my husband. I havent felt so free for a very long time and I finally come to realize that the offer for the two apartments next to each other were not what Allah had planned for me. Their treatment would have gone on and on since they were right next door but now I was several streets away and I had finally made them understand that I would not tolerate their treatment. Their hesitation after I made them the best offer ever opened my eyes that no matter how perfect my solution for us was, they would never trust me. 

And my husband feels free as well. He just didnt want to be the one to tell his parents that it wasnt working out.

Alhamulillah for the opportunity to study the deen of Allah. 

I am writing this to get as much information as I can get about a very distant and vague topic:

We all are curious about how Islam started in the Indian sub-continent. There are some mentions of Afgan Traders or different religious figures coming to this land in the purpose of spreading Islam. 

But very few questions have been asked regarding what was happening in this land at the time of the prophet. Especially, were there any reports of the immediate generations preceding the prophet coming to this land, i.e. the Sahabis or Tabeyen/Tabe-Tabeyen. 

The most intriguing point is: There have been a few mentioned cases (from very few senior scholars) that a mosque was built at the banks of Sundarbans (Bangladesh) by the Sahabis after the death of the Prophet named Mosjidul Sahabi. 

Is this true? And if not true, what informtion can be obtained realted or similar to this topic. Any information would be highly appreciable.

I feel like i have 2 personalities inside me (which probably means i’m an hypocrite). Sometimes i want to practice islam, i want to pray, i want to read quran and feel close to Allah. And then other times i stop praying and do sins.

I know we aren’t supposed to expose ourselves but i’m seeking advice so i’m going to be honest. I pray during the week and mostly because i’m going to work so i have a schedule and it feels easier. It’s also because if i don’t i feel extremely anxious. El hamdulillah because i think that’s a gift from Allah. When things are going well in my life i tend to draw further from Allah. I’m fully aware of this but it’s like i can’t help.

So on week ends for example i tend to not pray, i tend to listen to musics, to watch tv shows and other wasteful activities. The issue is i have forced myself in the past to stop this and to control myself but i end up extremely bored aghstarfillulah and feel burn out.

I don’t know how to entertain myself without sins. Many years ago i bought many books which are fictional and have love stories, magic, such stuffs in it. And i want to read them but now i feel like it’s forbidden so i don’t but it bothers me.

It started off odd. I only slept an hour before the previous night as I've had toubke sleeping recrntly. I get up at 7 to mow the grass, so the yard is nice and presentable for my little brother birthday party (he's turning 14). Eventually, the party picks up as more and more people continue to show. My adoptive mom's dad was said to be heavily against anything besdies Christianity, so I was to keep my reverting quiet. I've been excited to wear my keffiyeh around to symbolize my recognitions of plaestines struggles, so naturally, I wore one wrapped around my head. It wasn't tactical or anything it was just wrapped to keep my hair up and look decent. Digressing, the main point is that he noticed it. He spoke about Palestine and understanding my empathy and representation of them. He warned me there are others who will not take so kindly (which is ironic as my mom made it seem He would be just that way.) Later on my adoptive father had a drink or two and was joking around with family. He was talking about how we're still babies to him and such. Eventually, I joked back saying ""at least we're still young,"" to which he responded by calling me Mufasa. I chuckled and asked if it was due to my hair since it was long. After a moment of pause, he muttered, ""You look like a ******* terrorist."" This really did surprise me, even if it was a joke. I take my religion, Allah, and the miss characterization of Middle Eastern people very seriously. He's never hinted at disliking my choices or that they were distasteful to him. He did later apologize and said he was just talking smack, yet it still hurt. Granted, it was more suprise, of him saying it rather than me not taking the joke, yet even after I said it was okay and it didn't offend me, I felt hurt. I'm not particularly close to him or anything, but I try my best to be a positive addition to the household. Even his biological son couldn't believe he said that. I don't feel it's wrong for me to feel hurt and saddened by the happening, but I feel silly. It was smack talk gone too far, and I tried to pass the forgiveness and understanding Allah has for us all to him. Is it odd for me to feel this way?

1gd7rmv,The concept of forgiveness and how to deal with anger in terms of things not being fair,Soft_Barnacle_5065,2024-10-27 10:11:18+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1gd7rmv/the_concept_of_forgiveness_and_how_to_deal_with/,2,/r/islam/comments/1gd7rmv/the_concept_of_forgiveness_and_how_to_deal_with/,islam,"Salam everyone, 

I know in Islam we are encouraged to forgive one another and to leave it up to Allah, but sometimes I’ll suddenly get really upset and angry with how certain people after doing hurtful things to others can continue onto their normal lives while the other person has to suffer. Like they’re living life just fine. It’s not fair like. 

The feeling fades away tho, I do things like going gym etc to manage it but is there any other way? Are there any surahs or specific things you guys say to yourself to calm down during moments like this? 

I know the world isn’t fair, but often times when we are in the situation where we experienced the unfairness and we have to forgive and let go. It can be angering too.

I don't know how to explain this to my family about the disease. I couldn't bear the frustration of them towards me.

>A man came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and asked him what he must do as a Muslim. The  Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم told him to pray 5 times a day, fast Ramadan, and give Zakah, and he did not need to do anything else ""unless he did it voluntarily."" The man left, saying, “By Alah, I will not do any more than this or any less.” The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: ""He will succeed, if he is speaking the truth.”

>He صلى الله عليه و سلم also said: “If a woman prays her five prayers, fasts her month of Ramadan, guards her chastity, and obeys her husband, she will enter Paradise from any gate she wishes.”

When you hear these teachings, it can be easy to assume that this is all we need to do in life as a Muslim.

And to be fair, there will come periods of trial where doing the bare minimum of obligations is all we can do.

However, the teachings above need to be taken in the context of others. For one, as a teacher of mine pointed once out, they assume the conditions of each deed have been met.

But how many of us can say that we have prayed each obligatory salah perfectly, in accordance with the conditions for it to be accepted?

But subhanallah, by doing extra prayers, we can cover for this shortcoming: The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:

>""The first of his deeds for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound then he will have succeeded but if it is not sound then he will be lost and doomed. If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, the Lord will say: ‘Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary (prayers),’ and the shortfall from his obligatory prayers will be made up from that. Then all his deeds will be dealt with in like manner.""

And so it is like that with all other deeds. We have no guarantee that they are accepted, so we must try to do extra to make up for them.

We also have so many sins, may Allah forgive us all. There are teachings on how our sins may lead us to the Hellfire, even if we’ve completed the obligatory acts. The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:

>“Indeed, the bankrupt of my nation are those who come on the Day of Resurrection with prayers, fasting, and charity, but also with insults, slander, consuming wealth, shedding blood, and beating others. The oppressed will each be given from his good deeds. If his good deeds run out before justice is fulfilled, then their sins will be cast upon him and he will be thrown into the Hellfire.""

Alhamdulillah that the door of repentance is always open. Part of repentance is to increase in good deeds. And the more we do, the more we can outweigh the sins we have committed.

We should also compare our drive for the deen to our drive to the dunya.

Let’s take our approach to the dunya. You might be able to survive on a minimum wage job. Yet especially in our cultures and communities, we push ourselves to strive for the highest academic achievement, the highest paid jobs, the highest profits in business. And throughout life, we try to improve in this as much as we can, push ourselves to the next level. Even if we fall short, we try again in the future. We’d never advise ourselves to never go beyond the bare minimum.

It’s good to have this drive in the dunya, don’t get me wrong. But how can we justify ONLY having it for the dunya?

How it can it be that, for the akhirah, we’re suddenly content to stay stagnant at the bare minimum, and not even try to aim higher? How does that make sense? Will Allah not see the double standard that we have?

In fact, it’s addressed in the Quran, in a surah we're all familiar with:

>""Competition for more ˹worldly gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺, until you end up in your graves."" - Surah Al Takathur

Surah Al Takathur teaches us how such relentless drive is very misplaced. We are implored elsewhere in the Quran to reprioritise:

>""˹So˺ compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers."" - Surah Al Hadid

This Hadith also reminds us of greater goals to aspire to, and to push ourselves beyond the minimum:

>""Indeed, there are one hundred levels in Paradise, the distance between them like the heavens and the earth. Al-Firdaws is the highest and most ideal level, for above that is the Throne of the Most Merciful and from it flow the rivers of Paradise. When you ask from Allah, ask for Al-Firdaws.”

It’s one thing to aim high, and sometimes fall short. It’s another to refuse to try beyond the basics.

Furthermore, we claim we love the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم. He implores us to do certain acts of good, and he has seen Jannah and Hellfire. Yet we’re so quick to dismiss his advice, because it’s “optional”. Is that the attitude to the guidance of someone we love?

One speaker put it like this - we’ve left every sunnah because it’s sunnah, the sahaba used to perform every sunnah *because* it was sunnah.

Subhanallah, Imam Ahmed, founder of the Hanbali madhab, and other great scholars said that the testimony of one that doesn’t perform witr should be rejected, because it’s such an emphasised sunnah.

Now for anyone reading that’s only just reached the stage of performing obligations, then that’s great and may Allah reward you for what you’ve achieved. Don’t put yourself down.

As the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: ""Do not belittle any good deed.""

The intention of this post isn’t to devalue what we’re already doing. It's merely to encourage us (myself first and foremost) to do more - especially when there’s such a culture of wariness and caution around aiming high in the deen.

Yes, we’re advised to build up extra good deeds sustainably rather than burning out. But keep building at good pace. Keep pushing yourself. Don’t stay still.

I write this post as a sinner who is grateful for what Allah has concealed for me. I'm nowhere near doing enough myself, and inshallah I'll look at back this myself whenever I'm demotivated and feel inspired to do more again.",3,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.9,False,General Discussion

Like an idiot I resurfaced to a website called pink video chat, its like omegle and I came across what I thought was a female and she didnt talk or show her face which idk why i even bothered, but we chatted and escalated to talking in instagram he gave me the handle and like an idiot I followed him with my main account and what happened was he decided to switch to iMessage probably to get my phone number and we shared explicit photos and my face is shown, after some time he sent screenshots of my followers on instagram, and threatened to send them if i dont send him $500 i told him $50 i dont have 500 we agreed on 100 and then after that another 100 and then i told him that i no longer have money and that my next pay check is next Friday i obv lied to get some time on what to do, please i need help, what should i do? so far I blocked him on instagram although its too late and he got my followers usernames and i also contacted the authorities and they literally told me they cant do anything other than have it on my record, the scammer wants me to contact him everyday.

• Should I change my phone number?

•Should I post a story on instagram saying that I'm being blackmailed and some scammers have ai photoshopped explicit pictures of me and to disregard them delete them if anyone receives them?

How can i come back from this? If you need extra information to help me please feel free to share This happened a couple of hours ago and im absolutely terrified, regretting and angry

Im repenting alhamdullilah and Its a wake up call for me, I wont be ever do such acts again inshallah

lately i've been feeling like i have to leave an impact on this world, like i need to work as hard as i can in the time Allah swt has blessed me with to strengthen my skills and use them to leave a good message on the world through the craft or career i choose. but at the same time, I've been feeling distant from Allah swt while these thoughts overtake my brain - i was wondering, does Islam tell us to work for this? subhanallah, the latest Friday khutba I heard was about how we should make sure whatever we choose to do in the future (i am in my last year of highschool), we do it with the intention of helping the ummah. so, is this enough? 

  
it's confusing, because before this i always had the mindset of ""nothing in this dunya matters, just please Allah swt because in the end, that is what matters"" and of course it is what matters in the end, this dunya is nothing but the smallest fraction of the afterlife, may Allah grant us jannah, but i also remember seeing something that talked about how there were two men and one spent all their time in the masjid whereas the other stayed close to Allah swt as well but he worked hard and had a job or something (i don't know if that was the exact situation)

  
the point is, Allah swt has blessed each of us with different attributes and skills and talents, and i was wondering, to what extent should we work as hard as we can to leave an impact in this dunya?",1,True,Question about Islam,question,1.0,False,Question about Islam

I know that we are not supposed to ask anyone for help besides Allah (SWT), and alhamdulillah I have been getting better (I am a revert and used to ask friends for favors and whatnot), but I have a question about accepting unprompted help. If someone sees me struggling and offers to help me, is it permissible for me to allow them to help me? I don’t want my question to sound stupid, but I am genuinely wondering. What is the case of if I have a problem stressing me out in my life and I’m telling someone in my life about the problem not because I want them to help me, but because I just want to feel some support because I’m stressed, but they help me anyway without me specifically asking them to?? Also, what about the situation where I know that this person cares about me and will do all they can to help me and I tell them about a problem in my life knowing that they might offer help, is this permissible? I know that if they offered the help then I’d refuse it because I don’t want to inconvenience them, and I know it’s a better habit to just not talk like that to people, but I am curious if it would be sinful to do something like that. I’ve been in all of these situations and I’m just not sure if it’s permissible for me to accept their help. 

Also, I know I shouldn’t talk about my problems to people and I am trying my hardest not to anymore, but I have been depressed and overwhelmed and I say things without thinking sometimes so that’s why I’m asking.

I am very drawn to Islam and I have started reading the Quran. Can you please clarify my understandings if I am wrong? 

Bolded parts indicate emphasis. 

For example, it is my understanding that:  **Islam** rejects the notion that a new covenant was necessary because of human inability to perfectly follow God's commands. **Islam teaches that humans are naturally inclined to sin but also naturally capable of repentance and returning to God’s guidance.** The Quran stresses God’s mercy and forgiveness, as seen in **Surah 39:53**, which says, ""Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins.'"" **This perspective suggests that God's mercy does not require a new covenant but is available to those who sincerely repent and seek to follow His guidance.**

Likewise, in Islam, the need for sacrifices as indicative of an imperfect or temporary system. While there are rituals involving animal sacrifices (e.g., Eid al-Adha), these are symbolic acts of devotion and are not seen as the only means of seeking forgiveness. Islam teaches that good deeds, prayers, and sincere repentance are more critical for atonement. **Surah 2:177** emphasizes righteousness through faith, prayer, charity, and patience. **Therefore, the Islamic view is that God does not require a new, perfect sacrifice to offer forgiveness; instead,** **God’s mercy is already accessible to those who strive to follow His commands and seek His forgiveness.**

I am an 18 year old from the UK, I have been looking into studying quran(tajweed and tafsir mainly), hadith and islamic studies in general abroad in a muslim country. I would be really grateful if anyone could recommend and institutes for women in egypt, jordan etc.

I have been interested in doing this for a while but haven't looked much into it until now. I also want to fully immerse myself and be able to learn fully for the sake of allah so I am not considering any online courses. I also intend to learn the language of the country I go for example egyptian arabic if I study in egypt. If anyone could share their experience, tips and advice it would help alot!

Assalamualaikum. 

Ive tried multiple times to get married now, and each time the girl says that I’m a nice guy but just not her type. The last time I was rejected I respectfully asked her to be very candid about why, and she cited my beard as a pretty significant reason that she just couldn’t get past (she actually asked me to trim or shave it repeatedly when we were talking). She said I just looked ‘too mature’ for her (which was confusing to me since she said she liked older men. I was almost the same age as her but looked older).

The more I think about it, the more I honestly get the feeling like it had to do with why I got rejected the other times as well. She explained that most girls just do not like long beards and I honestly haven’t seen a lot to contradict that. I try to comb my beard and use creams and softeners, but it is still too thick and off putting to some (especially considering I’m 20).

I know that trimming or shaving your beard is haram and do not intend to do it for anyone’s sake. But, I am increasingly feeling quite insecure about it, as I genuinely did want to get married. What should I do?",46,True,Seeking Support,discussion,0.87,False,Seeking Support

The message was delivered during 20 years, right?? And if Jibril sent the message, how can we assure that Allah sent it and Jibril isn't just a miscarried angel doing things on his own.

  
I have heard the argument about the linguistic miracle the Quran is, that nobody has de skill to produce a similar verse. But how we know an angel couldnt do it as well? Maybe a higher being is capable of so.

Who told me recently that she is being married off in a few weeks time by her mother. 

She has never really thought about marriage and has tried to say no, she has cried and tried to reason with the mother but the mother believed that her child is “loved by Satan”. 

(The reason why she is getting married off in the first place is because she recently purchased a PC with her own hard earned money. The mother believes that this is poor management of money and that being almost 25 is seen as ‘overdue’ in my friend’s culture).

I wonder, is that not manipulation and pressure? I know that in Islam, a child does have a right to refuse and the last say, even if it may not be advisable to refuse. 

She told me that it is unlikely for the wedding to be stopped, for her to refuse because of reasons I’ve mentioned above. She knows that this is wrong (to be forced), and she is very reluctant, but it seems there is nothing she can do for now as the mother is elderly and just recently, her husband passed away. I’m not sure if my friend is the sole caretaker, however all her siblings are saying that she should just accept this and follow whatever the mother wants, make the mother happy while she’s still alive. 

If this nikah does go on, with her agreeing to it reluctantly, despite her not wanting it, is that nikah going to be valid? Would she theoretically able to file for a divorce later on, or try to discuss this with the man she is paired up with? 

The mother is very controlling, and I am having difficulty in trying to reach this friend of mine, the last time we spoke, I was told that the man was aware of the mother’s desperation and that they talked about it, though I don’t know of the result. 

All I can do right now is hope that he would be understanding and compassionate to my friend, and perhaps try to help her, because it seems there is no one on her side right now but Allah and myself who tries to reassure her that she can actually refuse if she wants, but yeah, she’s been pressured so much by the mother to the point where she wondered if she is such a bad person that Allah won’t ever forgive her. 

She tries to look on the bright side that maybe if she does get married, she can slowly be free of her mother’s grasp, and have more freedom. I know that some of her siblings moved away from the mother because nothing her children does is ever good enough, the ones that are living away told my friend they did it to get away from this exact thing. 

Whatever the situation is, I pray for her constantly, that she may be free in one way or another, without breaking her mother’s heart, of course. 

I just wish there is more I can do to help her, seeing her so resigned and defeated breaks my heart. She is not a bad child, she is always trying to please her parents but it was never enough, and ever since her father passed, she said her mother has gotten more strict.

Like the title says, I just started reading the Quran, I really enjoy that it is direct to the point, it is very easy to read. A theme I noticed is that within almost every chapter it empathsizes that God should have no associates ( this must mean in reference to Jesus in Christanity). However, in  **Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 62** it states that Jews, Sabeans and Christians can go to heaven. But later it says that associating God with anyone else is a sin that cannot be forgiven. I have also watched a shiek Zakir Naik tell a catholic woman that as long as she follows the teachings of Jesus Christ and not the church Inshallah she willl go to paradise. Coming from a Christian background this confuses me and I would like some more clarification if possible.

My heart was crushed but I was able to move on, but somedays there’s this nagging voice telling me he may have ended up in hellfire instead.

He was a good man. And he was a justice in Afghanistan, my moms half of the family love him. But my dad never liked him for some reason, kept saying he’s a terrible muslim. I don’t ask because the topic stresses him. 
There’s some history in my family that I may never get closure on, but I continue to love all of my family regardless since at the end of the day it’s speculation. But I knew him as my sweet granddad

So I was hoping with the help of Reddit I could find quicker answers. What are some peoples favorite Arabic with translation to English Quran? And is there anywhere to possibly get a free copy (even if and especially if it’s in Arabic only, I do already have an English translation, but if there’s one of Arabic with English translation then I will donate my English copy to my first visit to a Mosques in hopes it will serve another well) Is there any advice for English native language people learning Arabic?

Jumma Mubarak! Since its Friday I would like to first share this Hadith to recite Surah Kahf: 

>  
Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “**Whoever recites Surat al-Kahf on Friday, a light will shine for him between this Friday and the next.**”

>Source: al-Sunan al-Kubrá lil-Bayhaqī 5996

>Grade: ***Sahih*** (authentic) according to Al-Albani

>عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ فِي يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّورِ مَا بَيْنَ الْجُمُعَتَيْنِ

>5996 السنن الكبرى للبيهقي كتاب الجمعة باب ما يؤمر به في ليلة الجمعة

>6470 المحدث الألباني خلاصة حكم المحدث صحيح في صحيح الجامع

And based on the two picture attached on this post (Quran.com), I have a question about the Tafsir footnote that didn't make sense to me between verse 18:18 & 18:19.

  
In the footnote for 18:18, the explanations in the footnote for why someone would flee & be filled with horror after coming across the youths sleeping in the cave are:

\-Their eyes were open  
**-Their hair grew long**  
\-Their bodies periodically rolled over side to side to prevent bedsores while they remained asleep

My question is about the second point about their hair growing long. On the one hand it makes sense to me that their hair would have grown quite long in the cave after sleeping for 309 years.

But in 19:19, we can see that the two groups start to question one another to confirm how long they think they were asleep. And some of them reply:

 **""Perhaps a day or part of a day.""**

To me because of this question being posed by some of them, it makes more sense that their hair didn't grow very long for the 309 years that they were asleep because they wouldn't be thinking about being asleep for a day or a part of a day if they woke up and saw that their hair had gown much longer than when they first went to sleep.

I'm curious if anyone else came across this Tafsir before and how you understand it in relation to 18:18 & 18:19.",0,True,Quran & Hadith,hadqur,0.8,False,Quran & Hadith

Throughout most of my life, I’ve had the surname Rahman and most of my life, I’ve had Arab men and others telling me how unislamic my surname is but also confusion as countering that people tell you never to deny link to your father etc. When we got married last year, my wife and I decided to double barrel and so her surname (3 letters and Muslim too) got added in front so it is Xyz-Rahman (not saying the real name to keep things anonymous) and thought it would be a good solution. My surname is very common in Bangladesh.

However, last year when my father was renewing some identity documents, I discovered that my grandfather’s surname was Ahmed! I’m in my late 40’s and the whole was a shock to me. The name Rahman was nowhere in any of his names. I asked my father ‘where did Rahman come from?’ And he said my grandfather liked the name and gave all his children the surname Rahman. So my father does not have my grandfather’s surname anywhere in his name and neither do his siblings. My father is very proud of the surname Rahman and would be insulted if I got rid of it. He doesn’t mind the double barrel as it’s still there etc 

But I keep thinking I really should have the surname Ahmed and my grandfather was essentially wrong islamically to delete his surname for his children. But if I changed my surname to my grandfather’s then a. I would be disrespecting his wishes when he created Rahman as a surname for my father and his brothers and sister (all who now have the family surname Rahman too and my cousins and their children). b. Fall out with my father.

1gbmnvs,"Sometimes during pray (mostly Tahajjud), I feel a hand touching me on the left shoulder. What is this?",johnsmith88712,2024-10-25 06:05:05+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1gbmnvs/sometimes_during_pray_mostly_tahajjud_i_feel_a/,4,/r/islam/comments/1gbmnvs/sometimes_during_pray_mostly_tahajjud_i_feel_a/,islam,"Aslam Alaykaam,

This normally happens at Tahajjud but just a few times during Salah during the day (I pray in my room alone as others are sleeping + just a preference at home). It's always random and not all the time. I haven't felt in in about a week or 2 and it just occurred again but like it's lasted a little longer then before.

  
It always happens on my left side (shoulder) like someone's put their hand on me and moving their finger a little. I don't look at it as I try to not lose my concentration. It always happened whilst I'm standing and goes/doesn't come back after I put my hands on my knees. Apart from tonight where for the first time, the feeling came whilst I was doing Attahiyat at the end (and still, it's on the left side).

  
I know Angels pray with us but I don't think they'd mess around like that? I'd assume a Jinn trying to distract me/make me look but I'd though the presence of Angels would make them too fearful to do that?

  
If it matters, I'm learning Tahajjud via a youtube video (which is loud) so the prayers can be heard by anyone in the room and I do best to hide anything with eyes in my room (which is just really on food/drink packages + my laptop symbol).

I always had plans to stay in Europe (albeit outside of Portugal), always imagined myself living in one of the northern countries due to the amazing general quality of life. 

Currently I'm living in Italy, however the rise of the far-right and islamophobic speech not only here but back in my home country too has me worried for mine and my SO's safety in the future. 

Even outside of Europe, islamophobia is rising in pretty much all western countries and in Latin America the living conditions aren't ideal. 

If I stay in Europe I might go for Spain, given the cultural similarity to my own country and closeness to both our countries, great weather, strong Muslim community in Catalunya and the far-right isn't as big as in other European countries. 

Also thinking of moving to a Muslim country but I'm unfamiliar with the politics in the Muslim world, so any help would be welcomed. 

I know in Europe there's Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania but none of them are in the EU for now and safety in Kosovo and Albania is also a worry due to Serbia, Bosnia I'm unfamiliar with. 

I know Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia are ""where the money's at"" but from what I know it's very hard to give citizenship/permanent residence and there's big issues with freedom of speech. 

Jordan and Lebanon seem nice enough, but there's also safety issues due to Israel... Existing.

_""He is not one of us who calls for asabiyyah (tribalism/nationalism), or who fights for asabiyyah, or who dies for asabiyyah."" 
[Sunan Abu Dawud, No. 5121]

National pride and borders have divided us for far too long. The conflicts in Kashmir, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, and the struggles faced by our brothers and sisters in many places are reminders of how nationalism separates us.

Islam teaches something different. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) reminded us that no Arab is better than a non-Arab, no white person is better than a black person, and no black person is better than a white person. Our true worth comes from our taqwa (God-consciousness) and our actions—not our nationality, race, or tribe. Racism and nationalism have no place in Islam.

When we leave this world and return to Allah, we won’t be buried with the flags of our countries. We will be wrapped in a simple white cloth, equal before our Creator. Our true honor comes from being part of the Muslim Ummah, not from worldly labels or borders.

Islam is our identity. Islam is what unites us.  
Being Muslim is the greatest honor we can have.

Let’s rise above nationalism and embrace the unity that Islam calls for. We are one Ummah, united by faith, no matter where we come from.

Together as one, bound by faith and brotherhood.

Sometimes life hits you with tough stuff that really hurts. You might feel devastated and think ""this is it, my life is over"" - but surprisingly, that same thing that seemed awful might end up bringing unexpected good things your way.

And flip that around - sometimes we chase after something thinking ""this is definitely good for me!"" We might work super hard to get it, only to find out it actually causes problems we never saw coming.

Here's an example: Think about someone who's really sad because they can't have kids. But maybe - just maybe - Allah's actually protecting them from something. Who knows? Maybe having a kid would've brought them more pain than joy.

Check out this story: A guy was super tired at the airport and dozed off. He wakes up to find his flight left without him! He's beating himself up about missing it... until a few minutes later when news breaks that the plane crashed and everyone on board died. Missing that flight turned out to be a blessing in disguise, right? But do we learn from stories like these?

So here's the deal: Trust in Allah, but also do your best in life. 

When things don't go your way, remember this important verse:
""But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not."" Quran 2-216

If you really think about it, this idea can bring so much peace to your heart. Remember: Allah's choice for you is better than whatever you'd choose for yourself.",0,True,Quran & Hadith,hadqur,1.0,False,Quran & Hadith

	•	Abstain from haraam food, clothing, and earnings. (Muslim, Tirmidhi)
	•	Make duaa with sincerity, firmly believing that only Allah Ta’aala will fulfill your needs. (Haakim)
	•	Perform a good deed before making duaa and mention it while supplicating. For example: “O Allah! I performed [good deed] solely for Your pleasure. Accept my duaa due to the blessings of that deed.” (Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud)
	•	Be pure and clean while making duaa. (Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Nasai, Ibn Hibbaan, Mustadrak)
	•	Make wudhu before the duaa. (All six major hadith collections)
	•	Face the qiblah. (All six major hadith collections)
	•	Sit in the tashahhud position. (Abu Awanah)
	•	Praise Allah Ta’aala at the beginning and end of the duaa. (All six major hadith collections)

	•	Convey durud (salawat) upon Rasulullah ﷺ at the beginning and end. (Abu Dawud, Musnade-Ahmad)
	•	Spread out both hands. (Tirmidhi, Mustadrak)
	•	Raise both hands up to the shoulders. (Abu Dawud, Musnade-Ahmad)
	•	Sit with humility and respect. (Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi)
	•	Mention your helplessness and dependence on Allah. (Tirmidhi)
	•	Avoid raising your eyes toward the sky while making duaa. (Muslim)
	•	Mention the Asma al-Husnaa (Names of Allah Ta’aala) and His sublime qualities. (Ibn Hibbaan, Mustadrak)
	•	Make duaa in a soft voice. (All six major hadith collections)

	•	Give preference to the phrases transmitted from the Prophet ﷺ, as he encompassed both the needs of deen and dunya in his duaas. (Abu Dawud, Nasai)
	•	Include yourself, your parents, and all Muslims in your duaa. (Muslim)
	•	Make duaa with firm conviction; avoid phrases like “O Allah! If you wish…”. (All six major hadith collections)
	•	Pray with enthusiasm and yearning. (Ibn Hibbn, Abu Awanah)
	•	Have a present heart and mind, with hope that your duaa will be accepted. (Haakim)
	•	Make duaa earnestly and insistently. (Nasai, Hakim, Abu Awanah)
	•	Abstain from duaas involving severing family ties or committing sins. (Muslim, Tirmidhi)
	•	Don’t pray for impossible things, e.g., transformation into a different gender or height. (Nasai, Bukhari)

	•	Avoid making duaa that confines Allah’s mercy to yourself alone. (Bukhari, Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Majah)
	•	Ask only Allah Ta’aala for all your needs, without depending on His creation. (Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibbaan)
	•	Rub your hands over your face at the end of the duaa. (Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibbaan, Majah, Hakim)
	•	Be patient and avoid saying, “I’ve made duaa repeatedly, but it hasn’t been accepted.” (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Majah)

Duaa is the essence of humility and dependence on Allah ﷻ. It reflects our recognition that nothing occurs without His Will and Power. In duaa, we express our utter helplessness and reliance on the All-Powerful, while acknowledging His freedom from all needs. This humility, deeply embedded in the act of duaa, is why the Prophet ﷺ defined it as the essence of worship.

Allah ﷻ has commanded us to ask Him for all our needs:

“And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed, I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.” (Quran 2:186)

Imam Abdullah al-Haddad beautifully captures this state in his poem:

“My Lord’s knowledge has fully sufficed me,
No more do I seek or choose.
My prayers and supplications,
Bear witness to my utter dependence.
Thus, in times of ease and difficulty,
I beseech Him with utmost sincerity.
As a humble servant, my pride lies,
In embracing my poverty and reliance.”",0,True,Quran & Hadith,hadqur,1.0,False,Quran & Hadith

I am interested in doing a cursory study of fiqh according to the various madhahib.

It does not have to be complete list of books, but I think as long as I could get a basic grasp of the obligatory knowledges, the framework for how fiqh is discussed and presented and the usul of the madhhab, then that would suffice me I think.

I have a question regarding mountaineering, camping, hiking, and exploring nature in general. Sometimes, these activities come with inherent risks, and I understand and acknowledge those risks when I participate in them. My intention is not to cause harm to myself or die, but I also recognize that there's always a possibility something could go wrong, and thoughts of death sometimes cross my mind.

In these situations, I try to take precautions and avoid danger, but I’m not really scared because I trust in Allah and have thoughts of Jannah and His mercy. I was wondering, does Islam consider this kind of risk-taking to be the same as suicide, or is it different since I’m not intending to harm myself, just appreciating nature and the challenge of it?

I pray to Allah that this becomes a means for you to begin your Quran journey without delaying even a second of your time.

I used to be that foolish kid who was too embarrassed to join Quran lessons because they felt too old. To the old me who thought they could teach themselves through the ever distracting internet. And for having fallen into the mistaken idea that you can teach yourself when even the Prophet (peace be upon him) had a teacher, Angel Jibril who would revise with him consistently throughout the years, especially during Ramadan.  Once I finally joined, I realised that many of us were much older, and no one really cared. In fact, we were incredibly happy to have embarked on this Quran journey together. Honestly, I felt an immense sense of regret, because 10 years ago someone had approached me to join, but I never went. As my teacher said, there are two types of people who don’t learn the Quran: those who are arrogant and those who are incredibly shy. But alhamdulillah, this was written for me.

The Quran is the Kalam (word) of Allah, so we must treat it as such. Sadly, there are too many people who don't seem to understand the importance of reading the Quran as it was intended. I used to think that beautiful recitation was something you were born with, but most of it actually comes down to learning the rules of tajweed. SubhanAllah, what a difference these lessons have made for me! The truth is, you’ll never be fully able to hear your own mistakes when you recite, so it helps immensely to have a teacher correct you.

The Quran is shifaa for the heart, a companion in this life, and an intercessor in the next. Don’t let it gather dust on the bookshelf. And remember, only a clean heart will be able to fully concentrate on and value the words of Allah. So, let go of all those useless apps and secret habits that can get in the way of getting closer to the righteous path. Don’t let the whispers of Shaytaan get to you, and increase in making sincere dua against these sins (praise Allah + salawat on the Prophet + ask for forgiveness + your dua + salawat on the Prophet + praise Allah = Ameen).

And remember, it is an obligation upon every Muslim to work towards their Akirah. If you want any recommendations, please let me know.

I’m an 18y/o revert Muslimah, and I’m seeking some direction,, After diving into various religions like Christianity, hinduism,buddhism,atheism i arrived at the FIRM conclusion that Islam is the truth. However, I don’t come from a religious background :( nor do I live in a Muslim majority country, so finding someone with deep knowledge of Islam is nearly impossible, I'm a very curious person, I love to study thoroughly about such topics and only accept something with firm logical background i’ve been self studying about islam through PDFs and even printed some books for self, (except for Qur'an coz it's available)but I feel like I’m just scratching the surface. 

I have a solid belief in Allah s.w.t but what comes next is a bit blurry and In-Grey to me I’ve started reading some history, but honestly,, there’s a lot I haven't grasp fully yet,  The concept of fiqh and understanding how to apply it to daily life seems complex to me, Then there’s the issue of different schools of thought, and then sects and navigating all this without guidance is overwhelming for me, because I understand this can't be self taught, IAM also confused by cultural practices that seem to mix with religion sometimes it’s hard to know what’s truly Islamic and what’s just tradition because I've come across some people who did demotivate me by their beliefs somehow.

I'm Somebody who approaches things very logically (Intensely ) I ask a lot of questions to make sense of it all. I’ve been told that questioning too much is close to doubting Allah, and it makes me hesitant, I want to dig deeper into the teachings of the Prophet p.b.u.h and find authentic sources, but I feel like I’m drowning in conflicting opinions :(

In Eastern Asian cultures, filial piety is pretty much one of the foundations in society. 

I’m Indonesian. Growing up my parents particularly my mother would teach me Islam. The vast majority of things I learned through them revolves around the dichotomy between parent and child. These are the things that Ive learned. 

1: Heaven lies in the bottom of the mother’s foot
2: Mother comes 3rd next to Allah SWA and Prophet Muhammad PBUH
3: If both parents need your attention, the mother comes first. Mother’s needs comes 3 times before the father does. Mother, mother, mother, and then father
4: Once a woman becomes a mother, she is not obligated to work anymore. Her mahram is responsible for her wellbeing 
5: For sons, a mother’s word is absolute and should not be argued against 
6: Anything a mother says to their children is a prayer

I am currently applying for jobs and have gotten a job interview for tomorrow morning.

For more context, I live in the United States and I also don’t wear a hijab (I am working on that inshAllah), so I don’t think people would be able to tell that I am actually a Muslim who practices her religion from my appearance.

I will certainly have several other job interviews besides the one I have tomorrow, so the following question is not specifically only for the latter :

Has anyone mentioned to the employer during an interview their obligation for prayer when it is time ? Is it appropriate to do so ? How does someone go about bringing this up ? Does anyone have any experience or tips on how to do this ?

I’m kind of lost because for me it’s extremely necessary that I bring this topic up considering the fact that I want a job that will NOT interfere with my obligation to fulfill my prayers, and I also want to make sure the employer is comfortable with my practices and I won’t have any issue whatsoever. But I don’t know what the appropriate way is to deal with this ?

I need tips on how to go about this if you have any please share, thank you !

I have a question in regard to free mixing. For reference I am in the USA. I understand that unnecessary free mixing is not permissible. I just want to go to the gym and do some climbing. There are no all male gyms near me, there's no all male climbing near me. I don't go to gaze at the other gender, my intentions are pure. Is this permissible? I don't have the space nor money to set up a home gym.   
For this saying it's not permissible and that free mixing is not allowed under any circumstances, maybe consider this:  
If I wanted to avoid free mixing completely, I think genuinely the only things I could do not relating to survival is walk around the neighborhood (gaze lowered).   
Can't go to the mall, can't go to the gym, walking on a trail has other people which could be of the opposite gender, going around any city areas would be bad too as there's a lot of free mixing. For those who say that it's not permissible due to the clothing in the gyms.

People dress like this on the street as well. All the time people walk around with indecent clothing whether to take a run, go shopping, etc... People don't care anymore, using the argument of indecent clothing while it may be true people dress indecently in physical areas, doesn't apply as people do the same regardless of where you go.

I am just looking for a bit of guidance, I don't want to stay home all day. I want to go out and get some exercise done, and do things that I enjoy. I understand this life is a test, but that doesn't mean I have to be miserable.

Basically, are there foods I should definitely avoid buying/serving? For example, I can see that pork is not halal, but does food have to specifically be labelled as halal to be okay? Should I just avoid serving meat to be safe? Are there certain types of foods or UK brands that are typically safe to serve? Do I need to use separate dishes, like for kosher food?

Also, we're planning on going trick or treating for Halloween. Should I be checking their sweets too, or maybe tell them to wait until they go home to eat the sweets so their parents can check?

As expected. majority of this time things went well and sometimes things went bad.

This all changed about 2.5 years ago.

For the last 2.5 years, only bad things have been happening to me.

And before anyone says it, being alive or having food to eat is not something good as even the worst kuffar have this also without any issue.

It's become so predictable that I pretty much know how things will turn out before they even happen regardless of how much or how little effort I put in.

Dua is even worse.

If I make dua for something, not only do I not get it, but I get an outcome far worse than what I could have imagined.

I have literally developed a phobia of making dua.

It's so consistent that the idea of making dua scares me as I know things will turn out 100x more horrible if do it.

This might all seem like I am exaggerating, but I promise you I am being 100% truthful.

I love and believe in Allah, but regardless of much I look in to my situation, I can't interpret it in any other way than this:

Allah doesn't want me to be Muslim.

It's like if everytime you touch a certain door knob you get an electric shock, would any sane person not come to the conclusion that they shouldn't touch it anymore and more over they should keep a distance from it?

This is exactly what is happening with me and islam

To make it short, I'm in a lovely relationship with this man since a year now. It's a perfect match, almost soulmates-like... The only difference : he's Muslim and I'm not.

I definitely do have some spirituality in me, but as many Europeans, I mostly received no religious education and so that's not my biggest concern.

Lately, my boyfriend feels really bad about our relationship. He says that it's ""Haram"", which makes me feel bad because I'm also particularly anxious and it makes me feel like I'm the problem.

He told me that if I was Muslim, everything would be so much easier, we would both repent and marry, and only then he would no longer feel too bad about it. 

He really wants to be a good Muslim and as I'm not Muslim myself, I know our relationship thus makes him think a lot. 

I've already learned quite a lot about Islam, I even pray with him sometimes. It's just that ...well you know, I kinda have this ""atheist occidental"" mindset which makes me a little bit careless about all of this, at least not much as he does.

Of course, I don't wanna break up with him. I really want to marry him and do that in the best way. But isn't that wrong to ""force"" myself to convert if I don't really feel the need to ?

Whenever I am consistently doing good deeds and staying away from sins, I have noticed that Allah gives me opportunities to worship him, to pray to him, and to be mindful of him.  

Time and time again, when I sin, I noticed (after the fact) that my prayers have declined in quality. 

Many don't realize the biggest blessing one may have; opportunity to remember Allah.

The opportunity and the blessing to be mindful of Allah to seek his forgiveness and to seek good deeds is something many don't have. If you want to be more mindful of Allah, increase your good deeds and decrease your bad deeds. ",1,True,General Discussion,discussion,0.92,False,General Discussion

For obvious reasons this is a throwaway account. As a man I was wondering if I must 100% obey my parents when it comes to marriage.

I have known this girl for many years and know that she will give my parents more respect than anyone has and will take care of them like no one else. They do not have a problem with the family rather their past. Regardless of how much I try to convince them they refuse to understand that the girl does not have to pay for the past of her parents. I don’t understand what to do in such a situation. Am I supposed to go along with their “no” to this girl or keep pushing until I can force them to say “yes”. Any advice would be appreciated.

Al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihayn (5), Al-Mu'jam al-Kabir lil-Tabarani (14668), Al-Firdaws bi-Ma'thur al-Khitab li al-Dailami (1/114).

Al-Suyuti said in Al-Jami' al-Saghir (1951): “Authentic (Sahih).”

Al-Albani said in Sahih al-Jami' (1590): “Authentic (Sahih).”

Adil Murshid said in Al-Mustadrak 'ala al-Sahihayn [al-Risalah] (1/213): “Its chain is sound (Isnaduhu Hasan).”

[Commentary]

“Faith wears out in the heart of one of you,” meaning faith sometimes goes up and sometimes it goes down; it weakens in the heart due to committing sins or disobeying Allah. “Just as a garment wears out,” meaning how a new garment loses its quality when one wears it often! The meaning is that the faith weakens in our hearts as we commit sins, similar to how a garment loses its quality and becomes weak and tears apart the more one wears it!

“So ask Allah,” meaning ask Allah through performing good deeds, prayer, supplications, and the like, “to renew faith in your hearts,” meaning so the faith increases and goes above the original state.

In this hadith, the Prophet ﷺ tells us that faith sometimes goes down, while sometimes it is up. So when faith is down, one should accept it and ask Allah through doing good deeds to renew one’s faith so it is stronger and increases! The more sins one commits, the more his faith goes down, so to combat this, one has to perform good deeds, whether it is fasting or giving charity, engaging in the remembrance of Allah, making supplications, praying extra, and the like. So this way, one’s faith will increase, In Shah Allah!

This hadith was explained in more detail by Abd al-Ra'uf al-Manawi in Fayd al-Qadir (1957).

And Allah Knows Best.

I don't want to anymore because I'm scared of what my fate will be. 

I haven't been praying for like 3 months now. I have waswas with purity so bad that after struggling for nearly a year with it I just stopped praying. I feel scared to even sleep bc I'm scared of dying. I follow the opinion that not praying is kufr which makes this even worse. I feel like there's impurity on me so I don't bother to pray bc its not valid anyway. 

On top of that, I'm sapphic. I knows its a sin, yet I still do it.  I stayed away from sins as much as I could for two years and would do tawbah when I slipped but after I stopped praying everything went down the drain. Hijab, getting piercings, haram job and money, caring way more about this dunya etc. If I start counting my sins I'm afraid that the earth would drown in it. I'm pretty sure that even the angels stay away from me. I started distancing myself from other Muslims because I didn't want to be a bad influence, its bad enough I'm fking my life up, I don't want the sin of another following me. Its getting to a point where I don't want people to know I'm a Muslim because I don't want to embarrass the deen. Cant wear hijab because my actions arent consistent with it. Like I said, If I start counting my sins I'm afraid that not only the earth but the galaxy itself would drown in it.

I reached a point where I'm embarrassed and scared to make dua bc I know how bad I am. Before all I wanted to do was die a Muslim. That was it and I didn't care if I had to go through jahanam before getting out after serving my time but now I'm genuinely terrified. just doing the bare minimum is the hardest thing for me. Something as basic as praying fajr is so hard. Using the bathroom took me 30 minutes minimum. I couldn't even eat at home bc it was impure. My OCD got so bad that everything was contaminated in my head and after a year I just gave up

Like that one guy from the hadith, if I could burn my body to ashes so I wouldn't go to the akirah and so I wouldn't be brought in front of Allah I would. I wish I was never created.

Once i became a christian i started as a non-denominational, then i eventually picked catholicism and was prideful, arrogant and spiteful towards other denominations and faiths even, including islam. Then after some time i wanted to become muslim myself because i saw how islam changed people's lives and how muslim carried themselves better than any catholic or christian i saw for that matter, but i never went through for my life is very caothic and i dont have time to do all the prayers or focus too much on rituals, or to memorise prayers in a language i dont speak. As i'm writing this i'm listening to The Islamic Call to Prayer(Adhan) many muslims tried to help me and support me but i was too much of a coward to actualy listen or go through with it. Now i'm a biblical unitarian(i dont believe in the trinity or that Jesus is God and i have to say, i'm more at peace) i'm no longer Catholic, but Islam is always on my mind, the terms, the words, the language, the recitations and Adhan. i used to believe islam was from the devil, a deception, but thats far, very far from the truth.

1ganr67,Islamic definition of “Backbiting?” ,OG_Yaz,2024-10-23 23:50:21+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1ganr67/islamic_definition_of_backbiting/,4,/r/islam/comments/1ganr67/islamic_definition_of_backbiting/,islam,"Assalam alaykum wa rahmatuAllahi wa barakatuh!

I’m a revert since 20 March 2011. I frequently read up on matters, but I’m a little confused and need clarification.

I was under the assumption backbiting was speaking about anyone not present, whether positive or negative, because the person isn’t there to say they want that information revealed. 

When I did a quick search about five minutes ago, it stated it’s negative speech that a person wouldn’t like said about them (example: Dinah is gaining weight. She looks fat in that abaayah she wore today). 

Can one of my lovely brothers or sisters in Islam please shed some light with daleel (preferably with Arabic ahadith, ayat, or fatwa). I don’t want to backbite anyone, so if I say anything about anyone, I anyways tell them what I said and the person’s response (for example: “Hey, Amal! I was just talking to Buthayna about you and how you graduated with honors last week. She said she expects no less from you!”) 

The reason I ask is I am writing a friend a letter and mentioned someone, so I took a picture of the letter and sent it, as to not backbite. Everything I said was positive, but I am now confused on the rulings. 

Any help is appreciated.

I absolutely love my best friend. She is gorgeous, funny, Islamic, and honestly everything I admire. I've always looked up to her. She was doing well in life, alhamdulillah, and Allah has blessed me with a lot too with everything alhumdullillah. But recently, things haven't been going well for her—she lost her parent and has issues in her marriage.

I love her so much, but sometimes I worry if I may have unintentionally cast the evil eye (nazar) on her. I swear, I don't have any bad intentions toward her. She’s the kindest, most loving person I know. I'm not as religious as I should be, but I would feel terrible if her struggles were in any way connected to me. I don’t know why I keep having these thoughts.

I want her to have a good life, and I would never forgive myself if something bad happened to her because of me. Was it unintentional jealousy? I don't know. Please, can anyone help me understand why I keep thinking this? What should I do?

In our context today,  we have seen many people using the mental illness card to try to evade the death penalty or get a lighter sentence in their crimes. I understand there are legit ones who truly are insane. I am part of a social service industry but i would like to know more in islamic context since it is the most just. Mainstream justice is a mess.

In my country there was a case where a minor brutally murdered another minor with an axe on school grounds in a toilet. There a elaborate planning on his part. l such hiding and sharpening the weapon and cordoning off the toilet to prevent people entering while he did his deed. He even called the police after doing it.

During trial, they found him to have major depressive disorder. I know in Islam an insane person is not held accountable. 

Is there an islamic book or paper that address these questions below....

What constitutes insanity in our era of so many diagnosed mental diseases?

Are all free of blame?

If insane and still dangerous, what to do with them, islamically?

Is there any examples during the early days of Islam that handled such people? 

Is being a psychopath considered insane?

I bought Sour Patch Kids also because they were specifically mentioned on a website that listed ""halal candy,"" but there's some conflicting information about chocolates like Hershey, Snickers, Reeses, etc. Also the website was European, so I don't know if the manufacturing is the same.

If gelatin, specifically listed, is the only thing that's bad, I think my choices will work but thanks in advance for any advice! ",8,False,Question about Islam,question,0.8,False,Question about Islam

A man (born Muslim, close with his family) and a woman (revert, father kicked her out of their house for reasons unrelated to Islam) were once in a haram relationship with each other at one point and committed zina, but they both decided it would be better to get married and became engaged but continued to talk and hang out and do all kinds of things, but eventually they both decided to stop talking and stop hanging out for the sake of Allah (SWT). They repented and only texted about things necessary for their wedding and spoke straightforward to each other. The man went to bring the woman wedding invitations, and meet her sister, and while they were there, the woman mentioned being tired from walking to and from work every day, so the man bought her an e bike and gave it to her two days later. If the e bike died on her way to work one morning, is this a punishment for her sins because they spoke to each other casually before the wedding even after stopping and repenting from their major sins of zina and pre marital relationships? What if they repented from the unnecessary talking they did those two days where the man dropped off her wedding invitations and the day where the man gave her the e bike? The man and woman were also together when she went with him and his family to buy her wedding dress because her family will not help her, especially not financially, and she can often barely afford to buy food and spends almost all her money paying rent and utilities at her apartment so she cannot afford any new clothes. If they repent for the times they were talking while doing the dress shopping, can they be forgiven?

Remember that, one of Allahs names is ""Al-Ghafoor"" which means ""The All-Forgiving/ The Ever-Forgiving""- this is the superlative degree of forgiveness, not ""just"" forgiveness.

I’m thinking of creating a website aimed at helping Muslims who struggle with anxiety. The idea is to provide resources, tools, and a supportive community where people can share their experiences, find comfort, and learn ways to manage anxiety from both an Islamic and mental health perspective.

My goal is to include things like:

	•	Islamic perspectives on anxiety: Including Quranic verses, hadith, and Islamic teachings that can offer comfort and support.
	•	Guided Islamic meditations and prayers: Specific dua’s and guided mindfulness exercises grounded in Islamic teachings.
	•	Community support forums: A space to connect with others who understand what you’re going through, share tips, and find encouragement.

Before I get started, I’d love to know what you’d like to see in a website like this. What features or content would be most helpful for you? What would make you actually use it and feel comfortable engaging with the community?

Your suggestions and feedback will be incredibly valuable to make sure this website meets the needs of our community. I’d appreciate any input you can share.

JazakAllah Khair!

I've had this problem where i can't worry/fear being a hypocrite. Sometimes i force myself to fear being a hypocrite. Sometimes i fear being a hypocrite. I don't know what's wrong with me, + i really feel numb and empty in the emotional sense. I don't know if i do anything sincerely/insincerely, and i have a lot of trouble identifying my intentions. I do my prayers regularly, i read the qur'an with translation, and i try to remember Allah excessively. I already know that the hypocrites will be punished severely in the lowest dephts of hell and will be awakened with two tongues. This still doesn't worry me for a reason. I thought i had emotional numbness, but maybe that's just not the case. And i also have trouble identifying my sins, i don't know why. I'm tired of trying to fix this on my own!

I keep remembering this hadith :

Ibn al-Qayyim reported: Hasan al-Basri, may Allah have mercy on him, said, “No one fears hypocrisy but a believer. No one feels safe from hypocrisy but a hypocrite.”

but i just can't fear/worry being a hypocrite! I want to fear being a hypocrite or atleast worry about it.. :(

I actually used to fear being a hypocrite, but now i just feel safe from it smh. I don't like this. I don't want answers like ""if you don't fear being a hypocrite, why are you asking this question?"" i just need genuine help so i can fear being a hypocrite/worry about it.

I want to reconnect with my faith and become a better Muslim, but I’ve been struggling with the temptations and distractions of this dunya. I feel as if Allah (SWT) has been sending me warning signs, especially in the form of my anxiety, which has increased dramatically over the past few months. This is something I didn’t experience as much before.

Unfortunately, the lifestyle I’ve been living goes against my beliefs, and I feel lost about where to begin making changes. The company I keep encourages me to engage in haram activities, and I am currently in a relationship with my boyfriend, although we can get married Islamically when possible. However, I am not happy with the person I’ve become, and I want to transform for the better.

I don’t know how to pray properly, nor do I know the basics of living according to Islam. But I feel a deep longing to turn back to Allah (SWT), who has always been there for me, even in my toughest moments. Please guide me with steps on how I can start this journey and become a better Muslim.

I lost my beautiful little brother (he was 21 years old) last month. He had cerebral palsy by birth and he couldn’t walk or talk, just use to smile and cry like baby. His presence was charming and it brought noor in our house. I was taking care of him for last 5 years as i work from home so 24/7 he was in front of my eyes ,i was very attached to him and he was habitual of sleeping with me and he only used to eat with either mine or my mum hands, every night i think about him and cry while looking at his pictures.

His loss have broken me inside out,his smiling face always come in front of my eyes.
i was not a regular practicing Muslim and now all of sudden my thoughts are just revolving around purpose of our existence,death and concept of afterlife. Researching on YouTube and watching these agnostic,atheist views have polluted my mind.

Though i strongly believe in existence of one mighty creator and Islamic teachings as solutions of the worldly problems as praying brings peace, i am doubting the afterlife.

Since his death i started praying again regularly but searching too much on internet had bring my mind to confusion and i am thinking too much about that What will be the fate of all these non Muslims who have good character and deeds but they will end up in hell? why the supreme creator who is Rehman and Raheem allowing so much destruction by the evils in this world? Why so much innocent people are suffering specially kids?


I am also suffering from IBS which is chronic Digestive illness for last 2 years and it effects quality of life and makes person anxious, and now these doubts are further worsening my mental state.

I badly want afterlife to be true so that i could reunite with him and hear him speak which he didn’t do in this world and see him in healthy state.

So I really wonder how should a man realistically or practically approach a potential partner. (I’m an Arab if that gives some context)

I have a question for the sisters and brothers (each with their own). 


Sisters : how would it feel if a man that you don’t know or know very little of says he’s interested in marriage and would like to speak to your father? Is it weird to the point you wouldn’t consider it at all , would you just provide your father’s information and have them go through the process? What if it’s someone through social media but never communicated with. How would your father/parents take it if you mention someone is interested?

Brothers : what was the most successful way you have approached and been able to initiate the process of a relationship/marriage in a halal way (physically and/or over social media) .

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقُولُوا رَاعِنَا وَقُولُوا انظُرْنَا وَاسْمَعُوا وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ

Sahih International:
O you who have believed, say not [to Allāh's Messenger], ""Rāʿinā"" but say, ""Unẓurnā"" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.

So many tafsirs say that the word “Ra’ina” in the ayah was a word the jews used as a sleight of hand to insult the Prophet PBUH, may Allah’s curse be upon those jews. Because in Arabic it means “be mindful of us,” but it’s an insult in hebrew (some tafsirs say it means “our fool” or “our evil”). 

I just wanted to ask and see because I’ve been researching this for a little now, is there any current day hebrew word that is used that resembles the word mentioned in the Quran? Or are there any historical records from back then of a word that resembles it? My current assessment is that it’s a word that was used back then and then got lost through time, since i can’t find any current day uses of any words similar to it.

Hey, let me tell you something interesting about the work-life-faith balance.

You know what's amazing? In the Quran, Allah, the Almighty, talks about these incredible people: '[They are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah and performance of prayer and giving of zakah. They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will  [fearfully] turn about.' Quran 24-37

These folks figured out how to run their businesses without letting it mess with their worship. Pretty cool, right?

But here's what's weird nowadays - people keep saying 'Work is worship.' Sure, working is important, but let's get real for a second.

Think about it this way:

1- When someone sets their alarm for dawn prayer (Fajr), they understand what's up - they know they were created for something bigger than just working. They know they were created to worship, putting Allah's commands first.

2- But then you've got people who only set their alarm for work. It's like they think they were born just to be workhorses, pushing Allah's commands to the back burner.

Here's the real deal - when your work starts messing up your actual worship of Allah, it's basically like you're working for the devil instead. You're not really winning at life. You're kind of doing the opposite of what those amazing people in the Quran verse were doing.

I mean, if your whole life is just work, work, work, with no worship... how's that any different from animals? They just spend their entire lives plowing fields and eating too.

The secret is balance. Those people mentioned in the Quran - they had businesses, they were making money, but they never let it distract them from what really matters. They knew their priorities: God first, then everything else falls into place.

Pretty eye-opening when you think about it, right?""

I’m a software engineer working in a fast-paced industry where long hours and intense work are the norm. As a result, I find that my career consumes a large portion of my life. While I’m grateful for the opportunities and the ability to provide for myself and my family, I often struggle to keep a balance between work and my faith.

It feels like I’m getting too absorbed in worldly matters, and I fear that my connection to Allah and my deen is weakening as a result. I want to maintain that balance between being dedicated to my career and staying grounded in my faith. Sometimes I feel guilty for focusing too much on work. How do I avoid being completely consumed by my job and ensure that I don’t lose sight of the bigger picture, which is my relationship with Allah?

I’d love to hear how others in demanding careers manage to balance work and faith, and what practical steps I can take to prevent my career from overshadowing my spiritual life.

Back story: When I was a young boy (7 or so) my grandmother had an extensive collection of books. It always stuck out to me that she had a Quran. She was a mormon lady, and while well versed in all types of books this one just looked different. I asked her about the story and she sort of winced. Apparently she was a english teacher in the 80s and one of her students that was in the service brought it back for her. He had stolen it from an unsuspecting muslim in the middle east and thought she would appreciate it. She did NOT appreciate that he stole anything but thats where it spent the next 30 years. Recently, She has been getting older and asked what I wanted when she passed. I mentioned a few trinkets and the Quran as I always wanted it to go back to wherever it came from. She gave it to me right then and there so thats where we are at. I am not Sure I can even make this happen, But I have been to two Mosques in Phoenix and one brushed me off and told me they were closed and the other had no one there even though it said it was open.

My dear brothers and sisters,

I’m reaching out because I really need help. Lately, I’ve been struggling with a lot of negative thoughts, doubts, and waswasa, and it’s been really hard to ignore them. It’s starting to affect my life, and I’m finding it exhausting.

For example, today I saw a Muslim on my feed, and my mind went to the thought of judging or takfiring them, something I’d never normally do. I’m so confused if these are just intrusive thoughts, or maybe it's me thinking that way in the moment. It’s got me going in circles, and I feel like I’m at my lowest point. I love Islam, and I just want to practice it peacefully, but it feels so hard right now.

I also find myself constantly repeating the shahadah, worried that maybe something I thought or did has taken me out of the fold of Islam. I want to stop this cycle and get back to practicing Islam with ease. I want to seek knowledge and improve, but with so many issues going on in my head, I don’t know where to start.

I don’t have access to professional help right now, so I’m reaching out for advice. How do I overcome these doubts and strengthen my faith without being overwhelmed by these thoughts?

Please Help

I’ve really messed up. Like really badly. In the past few years I’ve done all the haram you can think of. Unfortunately it all started with a severe gambling addiction in my late 20’s. Which led to alcohol amongst other things. I’ve created a financial disaster. Lost a few hundred thousand in both my own and credit debt. My credit score I finished. Low 500’s.

But the absolute worst part about all of this is I ruined the relationship I had with my parents entirely. Deep down I’m a good hearted person, but the past 2-3 years have turned my heart and soul dark black. I’ve cursed my parents out and wished death and horror upon them. I’ve made evil wicked comments. I’ve turned against God and asked the shaytan for help. My health feels bad. I barely sleep.

I’ve quit gambling and other haram, but my biggest fear right now is Allah will never forgive me for this. I am actually really terrified of God and what I’ve done. Although deep in my heart somewhere I know this monster that was created by addiction hijacked my character and the goodness I once had.

I know many will say God will forgive me and is all forgiving, but I’m afraid that is not true. Is there any way he can forgive me? I was born a Muslim. I cannot just say my sahada and start over without sins. I feel like I will now have eternal karma and punishment for the horrific things I’ve done and said

With Halloween being widely celebrated in schools, neighborhoods, and in the media, it’s essential for Muslim families to understand the Islamic perspective and explain why Muslims don’t participate in this celebration. This guide offers parents an easy-to-understand explanations for Muslim children, while fostering respect for other peoples beliefs.

# What is Halloween?

Halloween is celebrated on October 31st each year. Its origins can be traced back to ancient Celtic festivals like Samhain, where people believed that the dead returned to the earth. Today, Halloween is a largely commercial holiday known for trick-or-treating, costumes, haunted houses, and pumpkin carving. For many, it’s a fun, secular celebration. However, it also involves themes of the supernatural, spirits, and practices that have historically been tied to non-Islamic beliefs.

# Why Muslims Don’t Celebrate Halloween?

# 1. Halloween’s Pagan and Superstitious Origins

Halloween has its roots in pagan festivals like Samhain, where people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. Islam, as a monotheistic faith, teaches that believers should avoid practices that involve superstition, sorcery, and the supernatural. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) warned against following superstitious traditions, as they detract from the purity of Islamic monotheism (Tawheed), the belief that Allah is the only one deserving of worship.

**How to explain this concept to children:** Halloween started from beliefs about ghosts and spirits, which go against what we believe as Muslims. In Islam, we don’t believe that spirits roam the earth on certain days, and we turn to Allah for protection, not superstitions.

# 2. Maintaining Islamic Identity

One of the core principles of Islam is to maintain a distinct Muslim identity. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) emphasized that Muslims should avoid imitating the practices of other religions or cultures that contradict Islamic beliefs. Celebrating Halloween, which is deeply tied to non-Islamic traditions, can blur the lines of Muslim identity and values.

**How to explain it to children:** “We have our own holidays in Islam, like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, which celebrate our faith and bring us closer to Allah. Just like we don’t celebrate Christmas or Easter, we don’t celebrate Halloween because it’s not part of our religion.”

# 3. Avoiding Themes of Fear and the Supernatural

Halloween often revolves around themes of fear, death, and the supernatural — things that Islam teaches Muslims to avoid. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) taught that Muslims should focus on positive, faith-building activities and avoid anything that could weaken their connection to Allah. Islam encourages believers to seek refuge in Allah from fear, evil spirits, and superstitions through prayer, reciting Quran, and making Dua.

**How to explain it to children:** “Halloween is about scary things like ghosts and witches, but in Islam, we know that only Allah can protect us. Instead of celebrating things that make us afraid, we focus on Allah’s protection and staying away from anything that takes us away from Him.”

# 4. Emphasis on Gratitude and Worship and Not Wasting Money

Halloween has become a heavily commercialized holiday, focusing on buying costumes, decorations, and candy. Islam encourages moderation, simplicity, and spending wisely. Additionally, Islamic celebrations like Eid emphasize worship, gratitude, and sharing with others, which contrasts with the material focus of holidays like Halloween.

**How to explain to children:** “Halloween is often about buying costumes and candy, but in Islam, we focus on spending our money wisely and being grateful for what Allah has given us. On Eid, we give to those in need and celebrate in ways that bring us closer to Allah.”

# Teach your Kid to Respectfully Explain Halloween to Non-Muslim Friends

It’s important to teach children to respect others, who celebrate Halloween, even if Muslims do not. Islam promotes kindness and respect for others’ beliefs and customs. Children can learn to engage with their peers in a way that honors their Islamic values without participating in the religious or superstitious aspects of Halloween.

**How to explain to children:** “Even though we don’t celebrate Halloween, we can still be kind to our friends who do. You can tell them, ‘I hope you have fun!’ without joining in the Halloween activities.”

# Planning Alternative Fun Activities for Muslim Families on Halloween

Muslim parents can offer alternative fun activities that help children feel included without participating in Halloween celebrations. Here are some ideas:

# 1. Family Game or Movie Night

Plan a family game night or watch a fun, wholesome movie together. It provides quality family time without compromising Islamic values.

# 2. Crafts and Baking

Instead of carving pumpkins, you could do crafts like making decorations for Eid or baking treats that reflect Islamic themes. This keeps children engaged and reinforces their [connection to their faith](https://pinkpastelstudios.com/10-heartwarming-islamic-gift-ideas-to-elevate-your-home-and-heart/).

# 3. Islamic Story Time

Use the night of Halloween to share stories about the Prophets, Islamic history, or Hadith that emphasize faith, bravery, and reliance on Allah. Here is a very relevant book on the subject, [But, why don’t we celebrate Halloween?](https://www.amazon.com/But-Why-Cant-Celebrate-Halloween/dp/B0CKRLSGNT/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.l-ND3_kNrt6EowBmGEKmNT6hi6VAAZk2c_XH0g5hvr6VS5lj15wSGt6jZjewGycstNQU1q86mMuZTf76gx7qQpEpI1c8lK_dfQFUKYjJz9iNXat7wC47LJbllfGdqdeURtcwsEHdUj_9H2Fbw-xvTKSerJm6kONOvUZbjZR_xVr4MoVc_KYgjuai9TgchVYZas4UoYhQ2GSerFKBq59Yp7JYOiyD0lfpc3S-r_Ul7mE.Tstsnv0lpZtvqSv1E72sA_RQBooExKYz2N9YxyuPcMs&qid=1725732774&sr=1-18)

# 4. Community Involvement

Many Muslim communities host events or gatherings around the time of Halloween that promote Islamic values and offer a safe, fun environment for children.

# Common Questions Muslim Children May Ask About Halloween

It’s natural for Muslim children to ask questions about why they can’t join in on Halloween celebrations. Here are a few common questions and how to answer them:

# 1. “Why Can’t Muslims Dress Up in Costumes on Halloween?”

Explain that while dressing up for fun isn’t wrong in Islam, Halloween costumes often focus on themes that go against Islamic beliefs, like ghosts, witches, and monsters.

We can dress up for fun during other times, but Halloween costumes are often about things we don’t believe in, like ghosts and witches. That’s why we don’t celebrate Halloween, but we can have fun dressing up at other times.

# 2. “Can Muslims Go for Trick-or-Treat?”

Trick-or-treating is a common Halloween activity, but it’s based on the Halloween tradition and often involves superstitious origins.

Trick-or-treating is part of Halloween, which is based on beliefs that go against Islam. Instead, we can share sweets and do fun activities during Eid, which is our special holiday.

As Muslim parents, it’s important to explain why we don’t celebrate Halloween in a way that is rooted in Islamic teachings and easy for children to understand. Halloween, with its pagan roots and focus on superstition, fear, and materialism, conflicts with Islamic values. By teaching children to respect their Islamic identity while showing kindness and respect to others who celebrate Halloween, parents can help them navigate the holiday season with confidence in their faith.

Offering fun, alternative activities during Halloween can also help children feel included and connected to their Islamic traditions without feeling left out. Through open discussions, positive reinforcement, and a strong focus on Islamic values, Muslim parents can ensure their children grow up with a clear understanding of their faith and how to respectfully engage with the diverse world around them.

By Mohammad Rafique Etesame

 

 

,

 

Almighty Allah Says in the holy Qur’an,” Lo! There are above your guardians, Generous and recording, Who know (all) that ye do” (Al-Infitar: 12).

 

These verses reveal that two angels namely “ Kiraman Katebeen” are appointed above every mankind to write his/her good or bad deeds. For example, whether the man earned money lawfully or unlawfully, abused anyone, or used backbiting, or made something wrong? Or, on the other hand whether he established worship, recited the holy Qur’an or remembered Allah Almighty etc. These angels are making an authentic and undoubtedly record of human being actions.

 

Usually when the people do something wrong secretly, they think that there is none to see them. So they commit such type of crimes that are not allowed by any religion or code of conduct. But, surprisingly, Allah Almighty Has set such type of secret witnesses above every man that are the parts of his own body and will testify against his/her actions at the Day of Judgement i.e. hands ,feet ,ears eyes and skin of mankind and the Earth is also saving the record of human actions. The holy Qur’an reveals,” This day We seal up mouths, and hands speaks out and feet bear witness as to what they used to earn” (Ya Sin: 65). Also reveals, “Till when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to what they used to do” (Ha-Meem As-Sajdah: 21)

 

And about the witness of Earth the holy Qur’an reveals,” When Earth is shaken with he (final) earthquake. And Earth yieldeth up her burdens, And man saith: what ailth her? That day she will relate her chronicles, Because thy Lord inspireth her,” (Al-Zilzal: 5)

 

Commentators say that the chronicles of Earth is that she will reveals the individual record of all human beings at the Day of Judgement.

 

At the Day of Judgement , when the book of deed of a man will be given to his left hand, it means that this man is sinner and his book of deed is as the “accusation of crime” charged against him. But, at that time, he will deny all the sins written in that book and will say that he did not commit any sin at all. Then these secret witnesses will testify against him to prove his sins and crime. When they will have testified against that man, then he will become angry over his body parts and will speak to them as the holy Qur’an reveals,”And they say unto their skins, Why testify ye against us? They say: Allah hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things, and Who created you at the first, and unto Whom ye are returned. Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye did: (Ha-Meem As-Sajdah: 22)

 

The mankind will be very ashamed of his actions did in the worldly life but it will not be useful at that time. This is the time now that we should make our book of deed better by good actions.

But I've actually noticed that ex muslims claim that they are knowledgeable in Islam and after learning they left and their arguments are also logical...This just caused alot of fear ...I fear that knowing something more might convince me to leave islam completely...which I can't even imagine doing...I had alot of love for my deen..And now I can't even convince myself to pray or recites my favourite duas which I used to love...I will appreciate some genuine advice..
Ps: Im about to get married to a hafiz man..who is the sweetest person I used to pray for..He is steadfast on deen..And somehow I feel my lack of faith is disloyalty towards him too.

I’m going to give a quick overview first about myself. I come from an arab muslim family. Alhamdullah i do all of my 5 prayers, I fast, do good, avoid haram, don’t drink alcohol and so on. 

I live with my parents but soon moving in alone, and I’m  27 years old i lf it matters. I have group of friends both male and females, my core close friends are females actually ( i know its wrong) 

My main issue is that I really don’t feel connection with allah, for example when I’m praying, i don’t feel any connection there or any emotions, I’m like a wall. If i do dua, I feel no one is listening and its all useless. 

I’m fighting such thoughts constantly knowing its shaytan blocking me, but to be honest I’m getting tired. For example if I miss prayer, I’m like its ok I will do it when i get home. 

Its like I’m dealing now with my religion as in its secondary thing, if im free i will go pray, if im busy i can miss it. And i really don’t like that. Hence why im writing this post.

I just recently started missing; but already for long time i don’t feel connection.

Sometimes my brain feeds me thoughts such as why even bother ( sure its shaytan) 

Please advice on how i feel my religion in a spiritual way and feel it rather than just doing everything and still feeling empty.

All people around me are non religious people, from work to friends to everything else. My parents are religious and they always try to guide me and they wake me up for fajr everyday.

Sanātana Dharma (Devanagari: सनातन धर्म meaning ""eternal dharma"") is the original name of Hinduism. It is considered to be the oldest living religion in the world.  Hinduism is often called a ""way of life"", and anyone sincerely following that way of life can consider themselves to be a Hindu.

If you are new to Hinduism or to this sub, review this material before making any new posts!

* [Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/about/rules) are strictly enforced.
* Our [Hinduism Starter Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/starter_pack/) is a great place to begin.
* Check our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/faq/) before posting any questions.  While we enjoy answering questions, answering the same questions over and over gets a bit tiresome.
* We have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/index/) as well.
* Use the search function to see past posts on any particular topic or questions.
* You can also see our [Archive of Important Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/?f=flair_name%3A%22Archive%20Of%20Important%20Posts%22) or previous [Quality Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/?f=flair_name%3A%22Quality%20Discussion%22)

We also recommend reading [What Is Hinduism](https://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/what-is-hinduism) (a free introductory text by Himalayan Academy) if you would like to know more about Hinduism and don't know where to start.

If you are asking a specific scriptural question, please include a source link and verse number, so responses can be more helpful.

In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).) Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. 

In terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), you can choose whatever works best for you. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).

Lastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. 

###Here is a section from our FAQ that deserves to be repeated here:

Disclaimer: Sanatana Dharma is a massive, massive religion in terms of scope/philosophies/texts, so this FAQ will only be an overview. If you have any concerns about the below content, please send us a modmail.

###**What are the core beliefs of all Hindus?**

* You are not your body or mind, but the indweller witness Atma.
* The Atma is divine.
* Law of Karma (natural law of action and effect)
* Reincarnation - repeated birth/death cycles of the physical body
* Escaping the cycle of reincarnation is the highest goal (moksha)

###**Why are there so many different schools/philosophies/views?  Why isn't there a single accepted view or authority?**

Hinduism is a religion that is inclusive of **everyone**.  The ultimate goal for all Sanatani people is *moksha*, but there is incredible diversity in the ways to attain it.  See this post : [Vastness and Inclusiveness of being Hindu](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/ese8rc/vastness_and_inclusiveness_of_being_hindu/).  Hinduism is like a tree springing from the core beliefs above and splitting up into innumerable traditions/schools/practices.  It is natural that there are different ways to practice just like there are many leaves on the same tree.

###**Do I have to blindly accept the teachings?  Or can I question them?**
Sanatanis are not *believers*, but *seekers*.  We seek Truth, and part of that process is to question and clarify to remove any misunderstandings.  The Bhagavad Gita is a *dialog* between a teacher and student; the student Arjuna questions the teacher Krishna.  In the end Krishna says ""I have taught you; now do what you wish"".  There is no compulsion or edict to believe anything.  Questioning is welcome and encouraged.

###**Debates and disagreements between schools**
Healthy debates between different sampradayas and darshanas are accepted and welcomed in Hinduism.  Every school typically has a documented justification of their view including refutations of common objections raised by other schools.  It is a shame when disagreements with a view turn into disrespect toward a school and/or its followers.

###**Unity in diversity**
This issue of disrespect between darshanas is serious enough to warrant a separate section.  Diversity of views is a great strength of Hinduism.  Sanatanis should not let this become a weakness!  We are all part of the same rich tradition.

Here is a great post by [-_Gandalf_-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-_Gandalf_-/) : [Unite! Forget all divisions](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/13pqnh4/unite_forget_all_divisions/).  It is worth repeating here.

Forget all divisions! Let us unite! Remember, while letting there be the diversity of choice in the Dharma: Advaita, Dvaita, Vishistadvaita, etc*, we should always refer to ourselves as ""Hindu"" or ""Sanatani"" and not just ""Advaiti"" or any other specific name. Because, we are all Hindus / Sanatanis. Only then can we unite.

Let not division of sects destroy and eliminate us and our culture. All these names are given to different interpretations of the same culture's teachings. Why fight? Why call each other frauds? Why call each other's philosophies fraud? Each must stay happy within their own interpretation, while maintaining harmony and unity with all the other Sanatanis, that is unity! That is peace! And that is how the Dharma shall strive and rise once again.

Let the Vaishnavas stop calling Mayavad fraud, let the Advaitis let go of ego, let the Dvaitis embrace all other philosophies, let the Vishistadvaitis teach tolerance to others, let the Shaivas stop intolerance, let there be unity!

Let all of them be interpretations of the same teachings, and having the similarity as their base, let all the schools of thought have unity!

A person will reach moksha one day, there is no other end. Then why fight? Debates are supposed to be healthy, why turn them into arguments? Why do some people disrespect Swami Vivekananda? Let him have lived his life as a non-vegetarian, the point is to absorb his teachings. The whole point is to absorb the good things from everything. So long as this disunity remains, Hinduism will keep moving towards extinction.

ISKCON is hated by so many people. Why? Just because they have some abrahamic views added into their Hindu views. Do not hate. ISKCON works as a bridge between the west and the east. Prabhupada successfully preached Sanatan all over the world, and hence, respect him!

Respecting Prabhupada doesn't mean you have to disrespect Vivekananda and the opposite is also applicable.

Whenever you meet someone with a different interpretation, do not think he is something separate from you. Always refer to yourself and him as ""Hindu"", only then will unity remain.

Let there be unity and peace! Let Sanatan rise to her former glory!

Hare Krishna! Jay Harihara! Jay Sita! Jay Ram! Jay Mahakali! Jay Mahakal!

My wife, Suparna, has performed a modern-day Savitri-Satyavan, aided by the skills of the doctors. As time goes, a month is fleeting. But being virtually wiped off the face of the earth is not. I manage to get the daily limericks going from the hospital. So people don’t necessarily notice. My frequent co-author, Aditya Sinha, keeps some of the columns going. More people don’t notice.

For me, the external world is restricted to a thin sliver of a window (in the room). I can see a pipe in the building outside. A monkey religiously clambers up every morning. It is restricted to counting the IV drops as they pass through the cannula. Drip, drip. It is restricted to requesting Harish to bring the urinal or commode. Sometimes, the bed gets soiled. Just a lump of flesh stretched out, stripped of normal norms of shame and modesty. Sometimes, in a wheelchair or a hospital trolley, I am carted from one building to another, passing through the melee, through the sun shining, through the birds chirping on the green trees. There is a world outside that exists. What if I am not there? What indeed?

“A new book has arrived. Would you like to read it?” asks Suparna. The book happens to be “100 places to see after you die,” by Ken Jennings. We smile at each other. How singularly inappropriate! I don’t feel like reading, even when I can. I don’t feel like watching TV, even when I can. The same boring news, the same boring high-decibel debates. It all seems so transient and puerile. But so am I, transient and puerile, a dot that might have been wiped off. In that event, what would have happened? A few condolences, perhaps even from important people. “Irreparable loss.” Perhaps a posthumous Padma Bhushan or Padma Vibhushan. A few obituaries. What will they mention? Trade work of 1980-s, law reform of 1990-s, State work of 2000-s, railway reforms of 2015, even resignation from Rajiv Gandhi Institute in 2005? Who remembers? Nothing seminal about such work. Had a role in the rat race, was temporarily read and passed into oblivion, buried in journal archives.

Perhaps the Purana Project, left incomplete. Manmatha Nath Dutt was reborn, to finish the Purana work. I will be reborn. But I hope not for this. Irreparable loss at the age of 70, when life’s productivity is as good as over? In another ten years, what social value will I bring? Can it be measured, quantified, imputed for? I give up the thought, too complicated. There are lives my life has touched, improved, even bruised. If they get to know, they may remember, with fondness and bitterness. Such people don’t write obituaries.

No social loss, not much. Private loss is possible. To whom? My sons have been abroad after graduating from school, more American now than Indian. “Will I hop onto a plane?” For what? You know precious little about India. You will be less of a help and more of a hindrance. There will be a time to hop onto the plane. Not yet, not now. Not in time for the last hug, but in time for the funeral rites. At best, send money, if needed. It was no different for my parents and me. However, that was spread across different cities in India. This is transcontinental. That was physical photographs. I will leave a digital imprint. Where is that old black and white photograph of my parents? Haven’t seen it for a while. Once in a while, they will look at those digital imprints. Some remembrance, some childhood memories, some nostalgia. No permanent loss. None to friends and colleagues either. A few drop in. However, a month is a long time. People get bored and forget. Why do they drop in and want to hear about what happened and when? Weak and withering, why am I supposed to repeat every trivia? Genuine interest, or a vicarious pleasure in death and disease? I want to put everything down on a piece of paper. I can offer it to them to read. Suparna vetoes the idea. Very rude. In the event, the only personal loss will be Suparna’s. It matters nothing to anyone else.

I think of Yayati. I have been unfair to him, interpreting it as desire for sensual pleasures. It is deeper. It is hankering after control over the physical body, the craving. Will I trade my life for that of Harish? Will he? Was “prayopavesa” such a terrible idea? Some animals still practise it. I spend my time with such conversations in solitude, thinking about Salman Rushdie’s “Knife” and “Ashtavakra Gita,” recently co-authored with Hindol Sengupta. “O Janaka! Give up attachment.” That’s easy, easier. “O Janaka! Disassociate yourself from your body.” Impossible. Except when, under local anesthesia, some surgical process is going on. The sub-conscious mind or hallucination? For a fleeting moment, amidst a blaze of lights, you seem to be whirled around the stellar system, separate from the body. A delirious moment of bliss. A moment you would like to recreate and replicate, but can’t. It is not time for erasure. The body will heal in due course. I am not sure about the beating the mind has taken, I think for the better.",4,True,Hindū News,,0.97,False,Hindū News

Due to maya, prakriti seems to exist. Just like how clay and pot appear different but only truth is clay. 
Purusha(atman) in a way is brahman but separated due to ignorance/ego which gives birth to different desires and then karma theory begins.

But my question is how ego/ignorance came into existence first place..

I don't get concept of god too. All I understand is brahman is just too vague for most people to understand, so god is just our proxy to understand the brahman.

The verse is as below:

>आत्मलिंगमविश्वरूपमादिमध्यानन्त्स्वयम् जीवाजीवदैवदैत्यमसर्वरूपमनिरूपम् |

>आदिब्रह्मामहाविष्णोश्चहमेवोसदाशिवम् विद्यालक्ष्मीपराशक्तिपरमात्मानोश्चपरब्रह्मोहम् ||

My guess of translation:

आत्मलिंगम-विश्वरूपम-आदिमध्यानन्त्स्वयम् - ""I am Atmalinga (shiva), visharoop (vishnu), the beginning, middle and the endless self""

जीवाजीव-दैवदैत्यम-सर्वरूपमनिरूपम् - ""I am life, non-life, divine, demonic, all-formed and without any form""

आदिब्रह्मा-महाविष्णोश्च-अहामेवो-सादशिवम् - ""I am the primordial Brahma, the great Vishnu and the eternal Shiva""

विद्या-लक्ष्मी-पराशक्ति-परमात्मानोश्च-परब्रह्मोहम्  - ""I am the knowledge (Saraswati), Lakshmi, Shakti, parmatman and parabrahman""

  
And moreover, Who/What is the ""I"" here?

I have an almost non-existent understanding of Hindusim, and this question was inspired solely by an ""Introduction to Hindusim"" seminar at my University. That is the level of my understanding.

Are there malevolent forces in Hinduism? Something equivalent to what Abrahamic faiths would call demons. If so, what is their origin? As I understand it, all ""things"" and gods are derived from a single Supreme Being. And so, are demons also an aspect of that Being? If so, what are the implications for the nature of the Supreme Being? Is it simultaneously good and bad, is it neither good nor bad, is it a mistake to try to reconcile a human understanding of morality with the nature of a Supreme Being?

I suppose this has become less a question about demons, and more a question about tangible incarnations of what we could call ""evil"" and the problem of pain in Hinduism.

I first leant of ISKCON in the early 90s, when I discovered Bhagavd Gita As It Is and the ISKCON kirtan audio casettes that were left to me by my father. We have been a proper Vaishnava family, more in the North Indian way, so we were never ""deekshit"" in the ISKCON path. Our family Guru has been Shri 1008 Ganga Giri Ji Maharaj, and ours was a rather  religiously tolerant family. This disclaimer is important because I am trying to say we have no bias towards ISKCON. 

Later in life, I got opportunities to visit their many temples in India and outside. In fact, many times their temples were the only connect to the Vaishnavism while being outside. 

You may not agree with their interpretation of things, but no one can deny that have been a net positive not only for Sanatan, but for the world! The world is a better place because of their existence. 

Find me one person who can visit their temple, look at the amazing murtis in the eyes for 30 seconds, and can say ""This is not a house of God"". Or someone who can listen to their Kirtans and not get goosebumps and feel a connect to the divine. A place does not just come alive with divine grace without a lot of sadhana going on behind it. I can vouch that Iskcon temples are such places. 

Sanatan by definition is an amalgamation of widely diverse philosophical positions. I have myself found myself attracted to Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda - Ramakrishna Paramhamsa Ji, Osho, Jiddu Krishnamurthy among many others. I have learnt something from everyone. The diversity of Sanatan is a reflection of the infite glories of the God himself. We can not define anything narrowly and say anything else outside of this is not Sanatan. 

Anyways, I will just repeat myself - The world is a better place with ISKCON in it, and I wish we have 1000 more ISKCONs! Jai Sri Radhe! ",51,True,Admiration of other Hindū denominations/scholars,,0.85,False,Admiration of other Hindū denominations/scholars

Growing up in a neighborhood initially designated for Indians during the apartheid era but later when the laws were abolished, accommodated everyone, I was surrounded by a vibrant mix of Indians, Coloureds, and Africans(I’m African or Black, as we are called around the world) 

Naturally, my school was a microcosm of this diversity, where we celebrated each other’s traditions with enthusiasm although with little understanding. I think most kids at school were just happy to stay at home (or go to events centered around the holidays) and not come to school but either way, Eid, Ramadan, Diwali, and Christian holidays were all cherished events. I fondly recall our Hindu neighbours’ Diwali firework displays, which we affectionately dubbed “Hindu Christmas”. The joy and warmth of those moments remain etched in my memory. 

Little did I know that life would lead me to develop a profound connection with Hinduism. Diwali now holds a deeper significance for me, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness, both within and without.

How do you celebrate Diwali? What traditions and memories make this festival special for you?

Wishing you love, light, and warmth during this auspicious time. 🪔 🪔 🕉️

Please comment if it makes sense. 

So hanuman had the ashirvad that he will live till the name of Ram lives. But in only last 10-15 years i have seen a tremendous change in people's worship pattern. People prefer to worship hanuman instead of Shri Ram. Take the example of hanuman chalisa or hanuman bhajans or anything. They are more popular than Ram bhajans or Ram stuti. Most of the hindus who worship regularly remember hanuman chalisa but very few of them remember Ram stuti. Even if people are taking Ram's name in between it is just for formality. Like ""Ram doot atulit baldhama"" Etc. 

I just want to point out that hindu's are focusing on hanuman worship which hanuman will never like. He will always say that please take Ram's name, I am just a sevak. 
This is because many texts tell that hanuman will complete wishes, he gives bal buddhi vidya, which is true. Be he does it only when you worship Ram and not him. And there are rarely any texts which shows how ram bhakti will benefit you. 
In kalyug, people run towards benefits rather than pure bhakti. 

See diwali is popular because Ram came to ayodhya on same day. But now it is more about laxmi pooja etc. because laxmi gives money. People welcome laxmi on diwali and very few people think about Ram. 

If these things continue then may be in next 100-200 years, Ram name will be completely gone. And then there will be no reason for Hanuman to stay here.

We had a Diwali pooja at home, but before the ceremony, my family got into a huge argument—really intense shouting and fighting. I admit I got involved and said some things I regret. Despite that, I sat down for the pooja with love and devotion, hoping it would calm things down. And for a while, it did.

But not long after, another argument broke out, even louder than before. In a moment of frustration and anger, I said things I’m really ashamed of. I threatened to break the moorti (idol) of God, called God names, and even said I’d burn the moorti. I’m not sure why I let myself go there, but now I feel terrible.

I want to apologize, not only to my family but also to Ma Lakshmi. Those words didn’t come from a place of true intention—I was just caught up in the anger of the moment. I’m struggling with a lot of guilt and wish I could take it all back.

I’m posting this because I want to share my regret and maybe find some peace. If anyone has advice on how to make things right spiritually, I’d really appreciate it.

Mr. Self-certified Revolutionary Dharmic intellectual and IAS babu Acharya Prashant wants Hindus to feel guilty in buying sweets and new clothes on Diwali because Bhagwan Sri Ram was suffering in a forest with no new clothes and sweets. So I guess by that logic we should all go to a forest and do what Sri Ram on Diwali instead of celebrating with loved ones with sweets and puja?!😂🤦

At this point, Mr. Prashant is running out of things to criticise Hindus on. His whole personality is based on negating every single practice of Hindus to reform it into a dry, pseudo-philosophy academic exercise sucking out all the joy and community from it.

Diwali is celebrated as an occasion of Sri Ram’s return to Ayodhya, doesn’t have anything to do with forest dwelling period of his life. Mr. Prashant is a bitter, angry man for no reason.

We let this go and drew another one early morning the next day at the same place around 7:15 AM only to find it vandalised by 8:00 AM and again around 9:00 AM (after I redrew it)

I then reached out to the security and wrote a mail to the administrator as advised. We’d asked for the CCTV footage but could not gain access to it as per property rules. There had been no incidents since then until again today evening. I’m attaching the images of the smeared rangoli below.

3. Day 3 - Gai Tihar and Laxmi Puja: On the third day, cows are worshipped, and in the evening, people perform Laxmi Puja to invite the goddess of wealth into their homes. Homes are decorated with lights and colorful rangolis.

4. Day 4 - Govardhan Puja: The fourth day is dedicated to the worship of oxen and is also associated with the Govardhan Puja, where people create a mound of cow dung symbolizing the Govardhan Hill.

5. Day 5 - Bhai Tika: The final day celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. Sister put 7 different color of Tikas in brother forhead (each color symbolizes various aspect of life like Money, health, happiness, long life etc) & also offers garland of flowers.Flower should be Makhmali (Globe amaranth) and Gurdauli (Chrysanthemum).Sisters pray for their brothers' long life and prosperity, while brothers give gifts in return.

Most scriptures for me are not very literal, neither do they present as completelu historical book. Ramayana, Mahabharat have supernatural elements and illustration which is hard to understand through a rational mind and I believe it should be taken as more a of abstract  and a apotheosis cuz proving those supernatural elements is unreasonable. 

For me my central aastha is on parameshwara, and directly trying to understand his personalities or what we call Devas and isvara. I am cultural but not as much as many present here and the practices have more historical, heritage and traditional value to them instead of spiritual. Spirituality occurs when I do meditation for them rather than rituals.

My ista devi is Bhadra kali. I connect with her personality and embodiment of nature very well and also understand the essence of love in her destructive form. But I guess rituals generally aren't always my thing as they feel more by the book than heart.  I want to practice dharma through bonding with universe as whole. For me sadhana is a better form of bhakti than upsana. I am more of person that works on reason than faith, not that faith isn't important. But for me God is us and we are him always connected.

And when somebody like Krishnamurti comes around nobody pays attention to him

Do you know him? What do you think of his teachings? would you say this is Hindu teaching? if not, what elements do you think are missing here?",28,True,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy),,0.87,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy)

There is no Hindu community in most Hindu households only in some Mathas does community exist.The only community I have seen people engage is in caste groups .Some upper middle class Hindus even have outright disdain and hatred  of the poor .Only times these people remember Hinduism is during festivals for aesthetics and during elections to support their political views .They use highly derogatory language  for plumbers and domestic help and people who do 'lower jobs ' .,39,True,Question - Beginner,,0.93,False,Question - Beginner

For the past 8 years, I’ve been a humble sadhak of Kala Bhairava, a powerful roop  of  Shiva. Known as the protector of dharma, he is fierce yet deeply compassionate to those who seek his guidance. People often see him as intense, and he does carry that power—representing kala (time) and the natural end of all things. But beyond this, he is a guardian, removing avidya (ignorance) and giving shakti to those on a spiritual path.

Alongside my devotion, Since I also practice astrology, I see Kala Bhairava’s energy at work in these cosmic cycles, reminding us that, like time, he is ever-present, guiding us through the twists and turns of life. For anyone who approaches him with a pure heart, he brings strength, courage, and clarity.

Here are some key hypotheses and interpretations:

*Ancient Hindu Texts:*

1. *Upanishads*: Describe multiple universes (lokas) within the cosmic egg (Brahmanda).
2. *Puranas*: Mention multiple universes (bhuvanas) within the infinite cosmos.
3. *Mahabharata*: Describes the concept of multiple worlds (lokas) and universes (bhuvanas).

*Hindu Philosophical Traditions:*

1. *Advaita Vedanta*: Proposes the idea of multiple universes (jagats) within the ultimate reality (Brahman).
2. *Vishishtadvaita Vedanta*: Describes multiple universes (lokas) within the divine realm (Vaikuntha).
3. *Yoga Sutras of Patanjali*: Mention multiple universes (bhuvanas) within the cosmic consciousness.

*Key Concepts:*

1. *Brahmanda*: The cosmic egg, containing multiple universes.
2. *Lokas*: Multiple worlds or realms within the universe.
3. *Bhuvanas*: Multiple universes within the cosmos.
4. *Jagats*: Multiple universes within the ultimate reality.

*Hindu Cosmological Models:*

1. *The Egg of Brahma*: A cosmic egg containing multiple universes.
2. *The Lotus Universe*: A universe arising from the lotus flower of the ultimate reality.
3. *The Wheel of Time*: A cyclical model of creation and destruction.

*Modern Interpretations:*

1. *Many-Worlds Interpretation*: Inspired by Hindu concepts, this theory proposes multiple parallel universes.
2. *Inflationary Multiverse*: Hindu texts' descriptions of multiple universes align with modern inflationary theories.

*Influential Hindu Thinkers:*

1. *Adi Shankara*: Expounded on the concept of multiple universes within Advaita Vedanta.
2. *Ramanuja*: Developed the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta philosophy, incorporating multiple universes.
3. *Aurobindo Ghose*: Integrated Hindu concepts with modern scientific thought.

While Hindu texts don't provide a direct, scientific hypothesis for the multiverse, they offer a rich philosophical and cosmological framework that resonates with modern theories.

1gfnrym,"hey guys, i need a genuine answer about how to live a Dharmik life with spiritual connection to my Ishta Parabrahma Devataa, especially in this conflicting time of Kaliyug. (no tea, no shade) just want your genuine opinions or guidance",av457av,2024-10-30 14:25:27+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gfnrym/hey_guys_i_need_a_genuine_answer_about_how_to/,7,/r/hinduism/comments/1gfnrym/hey_guys_i_need_a_genuine_answer_about_how_to/,hinduism,"i want genuine opinions or guidance regarding questions about how to live life with Dharma and with worship of ParaBrahman and Devataas, doing right pious deeds (punya karma) for goodness of animals, people and nature. And so on.       
       
         
(and please women practitioners also give their guidance. i need guidance from all people, females, males and everyone . and from a Aatma perspective too, where one is beyond gender or distinctions). 
      
        
For example, i want to know why bad people (people who do bad karma or paap) are getting away with things and getting their desires seemingly fulfilled, yet those who want to walk on Dharma and good karma it seems hard for them to do so, and sometimes it even gives them failure while being bad could actually give them success.      
     
       
I will give u a very real-life instance. As you know, if you work and are dishonest, trying to get 2nd-number income (black money or bribe money, or stealing noney from budgets) then you become easily rich, even can enjoy your life. And you can still use this money to worship God and voila here now you also have favour of Gods. Also if you are someone who cusses or swear-words (gaali dene wala vyakti, in hindi) then you also get friends and people get scare from you/don't interfere with you because u cuss.        
       
       
but people who do not cuss, because they know how bad and impure it is, they sometimes are seen as fools or weak. (agar koi tumko gaali deta hai, aur tum unko gaali nahi dete ho kyuki gaali dena ekdam gandi chij hai. lekin tum khud hi bewakoof or should i say ch#/tiya dikhte ho. phir se ek gandi chij yani gaali ne achhai ko haraa diya).        
         
           
And when u want to uplift yourself spiritually, then u cannot find a genuine real Guru or even a advance person. ""Kaliyug naam adhaaraa"" won't actually give you moksha, all the name chanting can do is purifying you for actual spiritual journey.       
       
         
1 – so how do i follow Dharma, and worship of my Ishta ParaBrahman Devataa (mine is Shiva, and i also have great inclination to Parvati and Vishnu) so i can uplift spirituall?       
        
         
2– and i am not doing this ""haa got u"", ""right in your face"" thingy. Whatever Vedas or Puraanas says, we just need the right paath. this ""got you"" moments will not advance us spiritually, this is why i think reading in Geeta that Krishna says a person should again and again read Upanishads of Vedas. because Upanishads actually give you the knowledge or connection to ParaBrahman.       
       
         
3– i sometimes come in situation where it feels doing Adharma is my only choice. For example i told u about Gaali (cuss words). i often see some wretched bad male boys and men troubling people and catcalling and cussing at people (and sadly a few bad girls joining them too). There is no other way to call them out, other than cussing back at them with such bad cuss-words like ""bhe#/hod"", ""maa k#/hut"", ""mad#/hod"", ""ch#/tiya"", and such. the bad words ""sa#/la"" , ""ka#/eena"", ""kut#/a"" is just so normal for them, in fact they use these words freely and feel powerful about it. And see a person not using these words as weaks.   Some of my elders and brothers cuss back at them, only then they stop cussing and using such bad inappropriate language.        
       
         
4– this makes me wonder. where is God sitting in all this? why does cussing gives them power, and the only way to stop them is cussing back at them. making yourself impure with bad words coming from your mouth. What has happened, and if this is the state, how will people walk in path of spirituality?        
        
        
5– there are Rishi Munis present even now in Kaliyuga on earth. Yogi Yoginis are definitely here, but why don't they destroy these bad people? and come to protect and uplift the good people who walk on Dharma and spiritual path.         
      
       
6. what to even do? we cannot keep dismissing things with ""uh bad karma"" , ""uh god is testing u"", ""uh god is cleansing ur paap karma"" . This is completely senseless. God can also come to fix and destroy the bad people, then automatically everyone can walk on path of Dharma. in Kaliyug, it seems everything which is against God and Dharma is getting full support, while those who speak of God and Dharma get bashed. Just see how Hinduism, the very core Dharma is most bashed . why the (irr-)religions of violence and bad karma are being protected as ""minorities"" . People today even hindus are trying to argue that ""cow is not that important"" ?!! Cow is verily a most important animal or being, all Gods reside verily in cow. Yes, you must not go in super superstition-mode , but saying cow is not important. Well the reason is, you today have become weak to protect cows , so to cover up your guilt are resorting to excuses that ""cows are not that important"" .          
        
         
7– so much more i can keep saying, the list will go on so long. But u get the gist of what i am asking. So how does one even follow Dharma and spirituality. And i again say, said it many times, but saying again, that i am not asking for any ""haa got you"", ""haa in your face"", ""here accept it, got u"" moments. I need genuine thoughtful answers and opinions/guidance on ""how to walk in path of Dharma and spiritual connection with ParaBrahman, or what methods or techniques can i use/do to sustain Dharma and spiritual upliftment with connection to ParaBrahman"".          
       
         
EDIT: i removed an ""example"" that i originally wrote in last paragraph, because some people were sticking to that 1-example alone, instead of talking about the whole post. The post simply asks for ""advice on how to walk on path of Dharma and spirituality"" and some people instead of answering this, they were discussing about just 1-last paragraph that too which was used as an ""example"". see, now i removed the last paragraph, the gist of post still remains the same, because the post was not about 1-last paragraph , it is about ""Advice on how to walk in path of dharma and spiritual connection to ParaBrahman"".       
        
      
EDIT 2: i used various ""examples"" just to give the gist of questions. i can simply remove all the ""examples"" and the post would still remain the same. Please do not nit-pick on 1-2 paragraphs which were used for example. Examples are used to demonstrate an idea/philosophy or question to help understand it better. if we don't use examples, the question or idea still remains the same, but would look like a plain block of vague text. so please answer the main question of the whole post if u have any advice or guidance, feel free to use examples to demonstrate ur idea/answer, but please do-not dismiss the question for 1-2 paragraphs used as an ""example"".",15,True,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living,,0.74,False,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living

He explained me how Vishnu did everything in the name of dharma but when a sivan follower did he is labelled as bad guy. How almost all sivan followers are portrayed as bad guys. How this societal hierarchy of class system was invented and widely used by Vishnu followers. How one can easily criticise sivan while he can’t say a word bad on Vishnu.

He went on to explain this as how this difference is influenced in modern day politics by comparing how South Indians are more sivan followers while north is more of Vishnu following. 

I am not that much of expert and I don’t want to create a debate. I just want someone with clear knowledge on this topic explain me how much truth does his statement hold?

Also many people like dr. Robert Svoboda and many others accept the aghori. I also want to, but i'm just having a little trouble digesting a few facts:

1. Are agamas shruti? Because their authority relies on themselves right? I've not seen any other sacred scripture refer to them as shruti, but the itihasas, puranas, and gita mentions the authority of the vedas so isn't it more of like a sect thing to raise it to the level of shruti?

2. If the aghori derive their practices from these agamas which involve human meat consumption, alcohol meat etc., not only the aghori actually, isn't all of vamachara tantra going against vedic teachings such as to not consume human meat, etc.? How can we reconcile the fact that there are two shrutis with contradicting practices?

I could really use an outside perspective on a tough situation with my dad. My family is South Indian, and we have a deep-rooted belief in astrology. I respect that—it’s part of our culture, and I even find some patterns interesting since it overlaps with certain aspects of science. However, I also believe that astrology can’t predict or explain every challenge in life.

Recently, a few conversations with my dad left me feeling frustrated. It started when he mentioned that some couples face difficulties having children because their horoscopes weren't checked properly before marriage. I felt uncomfortable with this, but I stayed quiet to keep the peace.

Then, it came up again when my mom and I were talking about a family friend whose son has autism. My dad jumped in, saying that this happened because the parents had a love marriage and didn’t consult their horoscopes. That was the moment I couldn’t stay quiet. I tried to express that not every challenge or “drawback” can be attributed to astrology, and even if they had followed it, it wouldn’t guarantee a “perfect” or “smooth-sailing” life.

Unfortunately, my dad interrupted, got extremely upset, and started yelling, saying things like, “I put so much effort into your horoscope, and you don’t even believe in it.” He called me rude and ungrateful, said my generation is disrespectful and overly educated, and didn’t let me finish my thoughts. It was really disheartening because I wasn’t trying to dismiss his beliefs—I just wanted to share that I don’t see astrology as the ultimate explanation for every life event.

I know he cares and genuinely wants the best for me, and I appreciate that. But I also feel that life’s challenges are influenced by many factors beyond astrology. Has anyone else dealt with a similar clash of beliefs with family?

I wanted to share and collect feedback for a project some of us are working on to make the Gita more accessible. We made [https://gitavachan.com](https://gitavachan.com/) where you can ask the Gita for a query in your own words and the most relevant verse so that you can then go read more and explore the knowledge.

For example, let's say you are dealing with some family issues, then you can ask ""What does the Gita say about family?"" or if you want to know what the Gita says about the earth: ""what does it say about the earth?"" and it helps you navigate which chapters might have the most relevant information for example:

\`\`\`  
The Bhagavad Gita provides a deep philosophical perspective on the nature of the Earth, emphasizing its role in the creation and sustenance of life. The following verses encapsulate its significance:

1. **Chapter 7, Verse 9:** ""I am the pure fragrance of the Earth, and the brilliance in fire. I am the life-force in all beings, and the penance of the ascetics."" This verse highlights Lord Krishna as the essence within the Earth and other elements, signifying that He is the vital force behind all existence.
2. **Chapter 15, Verse 13:** ""Permeating the earth, I nourish all living beings with My energy. Becoming the moon, I nourish all plants with the juice of life."" Here, Krishna explains how He sustains life on Earth through His divine energy, indicating that all physical conditions suitable for life stem from Him.
3. **Chapter 15, Verse 14:** ""It is I who take the form of the fire of digestion in the stomachs of all living beings, and combine with the incoming and outgoing breaths, to digest and assimilate the four kinds of foods."" This verse indicates that the process of digestion and nourishment on Earth is also a manifestation of the divine.
4. **Chapter 7, Verse 4:** ""Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect, and ego—these are eight components of My material energy."" This verse elaborates on the material composition of the Earth, indicating that all elements are manifestations of God's energy.

Each day of this festival resonates with a unique story, deeply embedded in Hindu mythology, that reminds us of resilience, devotion, and renewal.

**Dhanteras** (Dhantrayodashi) marks the arrival of Lord Dhanvantari from the cosmic churning, *Samudra Manthan*. Emerging with a pot of the sacred nectar of immortality, along with scriptures and medicinal herbs, he symbolizes health, wellness, and divine healing. On this day, we honor the divine gifts of health and prosperity, setting the tone for the blessings that the Diwali festival brings.

On **Narak Chaturdashi**, we recall the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura. With great courage, Krishna liberated 16,000 captives, offering them a life of dignity and freedom. This tale teaches us that even in the darkest times, justice and compassion can prevail, freeing us from the shackles of our fears.

**Lakshmi Pujan**, synonymous with Diwali, celebrates the birth of Goddess Lakshmi during the *Samudra Manthan*. In her divine choice, she marries Lord Vishnu, representing the union of abundance and preservation. This day also commemorates Lord Rama’s triumphant return to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, where he defeated the evil Ravana and rescued his beloved Sita. As Ayodhya lit up in joyous welcome, so do our homes, inviting prosperity, love, and harmony.

**Balipratipada** or **Padwa** honors Lord Vishnu’s victory over King Bali. By subduing Bali and sending him to the netherworld (Naraka), Vishnu restored balance and order in the universe. It’s also the day Lord Krishna lifted the Govardhan mountain, sheltering villagers from the wrath of Indra’s torrential rains. These stories remind us of divine intervention in times of crisis and the protective grace that shields us in the storms of life.

On **Bhau-Beej**, we celebrate the sacred bond between brothers and sisters. This day is marked by Lord Krishna’s visit to his sister Subhadra after his victory over Narakasura. Welcomed with warmth and affection, this tradition strengthens the ties of family, a reminder that our loved ones are a source of support and comfort in both victories and challenges.

Diwali aligns with **Amavasya**, a time symbolizing light’s triumph over darkness and good’s victory over evil. Just as the moon moves from darkness to light, so too does this new moon encourage us to let go of past negativities, embrace renewal, and foster spiritual growth. Amavasya holds special importance in yoga and spirituality, representing an ideal time for cleansing, introspection, and inward reflection.

As we light our lamps this Diwali, let’s embrace the peace, clarity, and renewal that Amavasya offers. Let it be a time to pause, reflect, and release what no longer serves us, ushering in new beginnings filled with inner harmony and profound spiritual growth. May this festival of lights illuminate your journey toward wisdom and joy. Just as the Devas and Asuras focused their energies in the cosmic churning of Samudra Manthan, may you too find the strength to navigate life’s challenges and discover the nectar of true happiness and well-being.

The issue I have in this statement is that this philosophy doesn't account for Dharma in to the picture as to may of the times it may be in the conflict with Karma you may need to do for attaining the Fala.

For ex : In recent times we have seen may job aspirants and students using AI for job related process , sepecififcally designed to test their competency ; in such a case your karma are not Dharmic in nature, but if you don't do them you are essentially losing out on job markets because on avg you would be worswe in your presentation.

I am not very practicing person and more aligned with karma and jnan yoga so I am not aware of the cow urine and dung uses. He asked me why do Hindus have such obsession with cows to drink urine and eat poop. Showed me a video of some South Indian Hindu women eating poop kept on temple stair as a religious tradition in some village and a festival in North India where people cover themselves in poop. Why such indeceny? Is it really what is preached as true? My very religious parents never made me do it?   
We all know our faith has unnecessary stereotype that cow dung and urine is consumed as pure and holy. But as a hindu from birth, I have never consumed it . In my village cow dung was used for manure and uple ( dried cow dung cakes ) for fuels. The urine at times was used in some puja, as sealant for old houses made of mud. But I have never read anywhere in major scriptures that we need to necessarily use cow dung or urine to purify ourselves with it. I also know krishna the one closest to cows never did it and neither did any major Rishi or saint . So why and where did this myth come from?

Some communities have this tradition of bathing in cow poop as well in North India. While I understand practices and how cows have been a central livelihood of hindu life, this seems too much. Are there really any major books stating us to do it or is it just a fringe idea that gained momentum.

One person told me during mahamari or epidemic people started using urine and dung to treat people cuz it might help in past as they weren't very aware of medicine. Thus it became a part of ayurveda and practice. What is true. This story seems reasonable but do we really need to continue such practices? Can't we educate ourselves atleast in proper sense to not obsess with cows in such ways that don't have any basis or is there any basis?",38,True,Question - Beginner,,0.56,False,Question - Beginner

Also I think the Puranas are very biased to the sampradaya they belong to - the Shiva Purana will obviously put Shiva on top, while the Vishnu Purana will put Vishnu on top, and so on.

Brahma is a very weird figure - on one hand, he (metaphorically) doesn't hold any weapons, he only holds ""pure"" things - the lotus, the vedas, a kamandalu, a mala. His 4 faces sing the four Vedas, and he is of golden color. One should meditate on him if one wants to awaken the Muladhara chakra.

On the other hands, there's the puranas. There Brahma is a liar, a rap\*ist and so one. he's obviously not a good figure.

I'm having a hard time ""cracking"" Brahma and connecting to him where all of those puranic myths depict him as bad. It's also very confusing because Brahma is basically Prajapati, which is very appreciated and hailed in the vedas.

I'm looking to hear your points of view regarding Brahma and how to reconcile Puranic view of Brahma to the pure deity that the vedas teach. Is Brahma ""good"" or bad? Is Brahma pure or he is the Maya personified?

The past has been bad , I don't see the future being any better, even when things are fine i get very horrifying bad dreams ,and I see it to be very difficult & miserable for me . 

I want to know through the religion perspective, if I die by myself what will happen to me after death ? I can't see myself getting into it more being more miserable & hurt . What can I do? Also if you could tell me a better way of undoing myself , it'd help too .

It's not just our family but a lot of Hindu people I know will eat literally *everything* but beef. The reasons I hear from people as to why they don't eat beef sound contradictory to me. I am told to not eat beef since cows are sacred in Hinduism. But does the Bhagavad Gita not say that all living beings are equal in essence?

I would like to go vegetarian, but truthfully, really want a try a good steak just once in my life. So maybe I'm just making excuses to myself. But does it not sort of contradict what Hinduism says to refrain *only* from cows? Or is this refraining from eating cows more of a cultural thing than anything? 

I know that ISKCON play a huge role in bringing Hinduism to western society. But I guess to a lot of westerners it'd be pretty hard to give up meat all of a sudden, so there was the more friendly option of only giving up beef?

A lot of my ""Hindu"" friends also don't really know *anything* about their religion. So I was thinking perhaps it's a way for the less religious Hindus to hold on to it. As in ""Hey, I MIGHT not exactly-totally interact with my religion, but I'm still Hindu because I don't eat beef.""

If you are someone who eats everything but beef, why? I don't mean any hate- I am just curious of the reasons because I feel as if it's just contradictory to Bhagavad Gita's teachings.

But never was much of a pooja person. Though i loved reading about our culture 

Then I came across people like rajarshi nandy and parveen ramakrishna, the tantra upasaks, Their books and podcast and videos along with om swami and his books

I started upasna with 51 mala of bhairava Naam mantra on ashtami upasana through rajarshi Nandy telegram group, I liked the principle way how satvic tantra upasana and i think this is the path i want to follow 

But i am confused, I am not sure who me ishta dev/devi is i dont really have much favouritism, I always liked rajas devta mostly, I also like vishnu, the lord narayan, but vishnu is not recommended to be worshiped in tantra, their is separate ways for him and also he is one of the great God os us, so attaining him takes lifetimes

Thorugh various sources I found that Bhairav is most fast to response to upasaks, I crave even the minute sort of experiences and people describe them in podcast and books, but then I found that if you don't have a ishta you should start with ganesha, I did around a month of basic name mantra of ganesha to guide me, since I don't have a guru and i dont plan on waiting for one, God will send one when I am ready, meanwhile in navratri i also did 32 names of durga sadhna, as among devi she and lakshmi are me fav

Then I came across parveen video where he explained how bhariva is forgiving and has a guru tattva, if you don't have a guru he is your best bet as he responds very fast and is the great guru himself, and I started with bhariva upasna with occasional special upasnas, then in one video he explained how dogs are important in bhariva sadhna and if someone is afraid of dog, this might be sign that bhariva is not the right deity for you, my grandmother died because of dog bite and I myself fear street dog, I don't hate them, but have a habit of maintaning distance for just is case, though I don't really hate dogs, but I much like cats

I commented on his video if I should try devi upasana since I like cats, he said devi won't come without bhairav and i would be better off with ganesha. But for some reason I have this doubt like everybody says bhariva responds fastest, and ganesha is his son, shouldn't worshiping bhariva best choice. This type doubt create miss trust in mantra and i know that one of the worse things. I also like the principal of Sri vidya and learned a bit about the, I am mostly comfortable with all deities other then the one which should be just called upon regularly like shamshan deities 

I am just confused which deity I should go ahead with, I like the satvic tantrik path for now, grew up in a vashinav household, have a bit liking to vishnu, but don't really resonate with things like iskon and others, liking towards rajas gods like durga. I don't really have ishta dev/devi and i would like to find them, I want to have experience of the deity, I know it takes years for that, but getting experiences with vishnu or shiva might just well take life times, I just want to know which deity I should start sadhna of who is like fast to give responses, so that I can fully dedicate even though it might take years but if I know he/she will come I know I can keep going, I want to have sense of trust in mantra, and if someone can help me figure out my ishta, as they are supposed to be fastest to you I would be gratefull

Please help, I will provide any other information you might need to help me
Also please if you are recommending something, like eg worship ganesha please also specify thing like which one like Mahaganapati Uchista ganpati and if comfortable recommended mantra or a link to it

1gdkbm7,A question about life karma and bad luck,Specialist-Shine8927,2024-10-27 20:23:32+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gdkbm7/a_question_about_life_karma_and_bad_luck/,10,/r/hinduism/comments/1gdkbm7/a_question_about_life_karma_and_bad_luck/,hinduism,"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit; if it isn’t, could you please point me to the right one?

I've noticed something about how karma seems to affect me. Whenever I do or say something that hurts someone—intentionally or unintentionally—it feels like karma hits me back almost immediately, whether it’s the same day, a few days later, or maybe even weeks later, but always pretty fast. I’m a big believer in karma, but I wonder, why me?

Why does karma seem to target me so quickly but not the people who are actually mean or harmful? I know people who hurt others consistently, but they don’t seem to get any immediate consequences. For me, karma strikes hard, even if I feel remorse or realize afterward that I acted without thinking. This has led me to question if it’s really karma or maybe just bad luck—or maybe a mix of both, which would feel even worse.

If it’s bad luck, I’m curious how it actually differs from karma. Without getting too deep into my personal life, I’m pretty certain that life is against me most times—like I was never meant to be born. I definitely feel like I have bad luck, like if if I feel excited or happy or ready, it’s usually short-lived because something happens, or something embarrassing will happen to ruin it.

It also reminds me of the idea that “the kind or sensitive often suffer more than the strong or ruthless.” It feels like people who are more empathetic or emotional tend to be affected by karma /bad luck faster or more intensely, while people who are more detached or intentionally hurtful don’t seem to face consequences at all. Also if someone does abd to me or hurts my feelings nothing happens to them

Any thoughts on why this might be? Or how to tell if it’s karma or just bad luck?

I work as a software engineer and the first 3 years of my career I worked in a company, it was very good and everyone praised me but then I decided to move on, I was full of confidence when I switched, in my second company I was put in a very complicated project, I take stress easily when I don't understand something, I lose my appetite in stress, so even after spending 9 months it didn't get better, only more complex and my mental health got worse, I completed 1 year there and moved on, the guy who got my work also resigned after 4 months, that's how complex it was.

 The third job was a small Indian service company where first 5 months were okay-ish but then I was put in big old project where the management was very bad, the deadlines and micromanagement were crazy, we were forced to do work in as less time as possible to impress client, the company was very desperate for this client. I resigned after 3 hard months and completed 1 year there too. 2 week after I left, I found out they fired 2 members from my team of 4, so I got out in good.

Now I'm unemployed and very scared with these 2 bad experience, I'm scared what will happen in the next company, what if it is also bad with bad management and toxic culture.
I know worrying about future is pointless and it's mostly luck but with these 2 experiences it's very hard to calm down. I'm lucky my family is supportive.

It's sad to see the media stirring up utter nonsense for whatever reason. The worst part is people who haven't had ANY first hand experience blindly believing the news channels. 

The vendetta that some people have against Sanatan Dharma is deeply unsettling.   ",3,True,Criticism of other Hindū denominations,,0.75,False,Criticism of other Hindū denominations

Every year, many intellectuals provide ""insight"" on Hindu festivals: Holi supposedly wastes water, Diwali increases air pollution, Makar Sankranti’s kite strings harm innocent birds, Pongal's Jallikattu shows cruelty towards animals, Ganesh and Durga idol immersions pollute water, and Garba causes noise pollution. All objections are centered on Hindu practices.

Meanwhile, globally celebrated events face no such scrutiny. On Bakrid, animals are loved, as in Spain's bullfighting, China’s Yulin Dog Meat Festival, South Korea's Boryeong Mud Festival, Spain’s La Tomatina, Thailand's Songkran, and Italy's Battle of the Oranges, which apparently have no adverse impact on the environment. Somehow, environmental damage and global warming are always attributed to Hindu customs.

Despite this, we Hindus mostly abide by Supreme Court and government orders. We know that the government often deflects its own failures onto the public. For 364 days, there’s no environmental concern, but on one day of Diwali, pollution suddenly becomes a major issue, with claims that world civilization is in jeopardy. The U.S. has been waging wars worldwide for years without facing scrutiny for pollution, but if we celebrate one day of Diwali, the world supposedly inches toward destruction.

So, I ask—will you burst firecrackers this Diwali?

I recently joined this sub, and while scrolling through, I noticed so many young people eager to walk the path of Dharma. It’s truly heartwarming to see the variety of questions, answers, and advice from all perspectives.

But there’s one thing I want to point out: some of us are getting caught up in really complex questions that might not be as important as actually practicing Sadhana. I don’t mean to sound dismissive, but sometimes we can get too focused on details that don’t matter until we start doing the real work. It’s like wanting to know everything about gyms, trainers, how muscles grow, and diet plans without actually hitting the gym.

Also, a quick heads-up: be mindful of spending too much time on certain podcasts like BeerBiceps. He covers a lot of religious and spiritual topics, but you’ll rarely hear him ask his guests to break down a simple sadhana or meditation technique. He’s got his own app for that, so it feels like he’s subtly promoting it.

All I’m saying is, keep up with your journey into Dharma, but don’t get lost in unnecessary books, endless questions, or podcasts that only scratch the surface. Spend more time meditating, doing simple sadhanas dedicated to your favorite deity, and chant with devotion. Trust that the answers are within you.

Also hoping to get advice from those most knowledgeable about this vs speculation/assumption, though all are still welcome. 

I’ve had murthies in my home over the course of the last 10 years. I got them at various points in the last 10 years as I wanted to start praying and just being more religious, having someone to talk to when I’m down and truly struggling. However, I have not prayed daily in years now, and over time, there are long gaps in doing anything religious (no lighting diya, no incense, no prayers/slokams). I am someone who believes these things are not as important as just being a good person in life. I feel doing all these ritualistic things are just more of bribing God for things, and when I do pray, I NEVER ask for anything for myself. I pray that I’m thankful for what I’ve been given and ask that God help those who are truly suffering, that’s it. I also do not like that there are certain times of day rituals/prayers can only happen so a lot of my not doing them is as a result of missing the timing and feeling that something (bad) may happen by doing religious things outside of the specific times.

With all that said, I’ve had a lot of bad luck in the way of trying to find a partner and more and more feeling utterly low in life and hating life. I’m wondering if my inability (and truthfully, laziness and stubbornness) to do prayers/puja daily and at the time they are expected to be done is causing this black cloud in my life. 

I’ve recently been contemplating asking the temple priest about how to donate my murthies in case this is what is affecting my life negatively. Not to say God has ill wishes towards me but that if the expectation of the religion/practice is to worship the murthies in a certain way, there could be negative consequences for not doing so.

Anyways any help or thoughts on this is greatly appreciated. ",12,True,Question - General,,0.54,False,Question - General

Hello folks, I'm an Indonesian Hindu that is currently researching about the Chandala, known likewise as untouchable or dalits. Primarily my research deals with the outcastes of the Majapahit Empire (14th Indonesian Shaivism-Buddhism Empire), but since informations regarding the Chandalas in that specific society is scarce, and since this system were brought in from India, I supposed learning directly from the source would be a suitable alternative. 

Now, my questions are twofold. First, what are the rules that a Chandala has to adhere? If you know any, please list them, even if they're specifics to your city or province.

Second, can you give me some scriptural reason why one is cursed to be a Chandal? It could be your own understanding or an exact verse. My understanding is rather shallow, but I supposed, as with other births, it pertains to one's karma from the previous life? 

I'm currently reading Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's undelivered speech ""Annihilation of Caste,"" which, of course, spoke against it, against any sort of caste system, even. If you have any books or article to educate me, please do share!

Here it is:

>तं होवाच किंगोत्रो नु सोम्यासीति स होवाच नाहमेतद्वेद भो यद्गोत्रोऽहमस्म्यपृच्छं मातरं सा मा प्रत्यब्रवीद्बह्वहं चरन्ती परिचरिणी यौवने त्वामलभे साहमेतन्न वेद यद्गोत्रस्त्वमसि जबाला तु नामाहमस्मि सत्यकामो नाम त्वमसीति सोऽहं सत्यकामो जाबालोऽस्मि भो इति ॥ ४.४.४ ॥

>Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.

.

>तं होवाच नैतदब्राह्मणो विवक्तुमर्हति समिधं सोम्याहरोप त्वा नेष्ये न सत्यादगा इति तमुपनीय कृशानामबलानां चतुःशता गा निराकृत्योवाचेमाः सोम्यानुसंव्रजेति ता अभिप्रस्थापयन्नुवाच नासहस्रेणावर्तेयेति स ह वर्षगणं प्रोवास ता यदा सहस्रं सम्पेदुः ॥ ४.४.५ ॥

Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. \[Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.\] O Somya, go and get me some fuel \[for the sacrificial fire\]. I will initiate you \[as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread\], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away \[and look after them\].’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

**My question: Doesn't it simply imply that Satyakāma's actual biological father is a Brāhmin? It did not say ""anyone"" who is this truthful is a Brāhmin.**

**This is exactly how Paraśurāma found out that Karna was a Kshatriya in Mahābhārata. An insect bit through Karna's lap whilst Paraśurāma was asleep on his lap but he did not flinch. Lord Paraśurāma on seeing this said:**

>How could a brahmana bear so much pain? Only a kshatriya could have done so.

Today I learned that the Carnatic Trinity were all Advaita sannyasis, who incorporated Advaitic teachings into their brilliant compositions. And heres another amazing connection - Tyagaraja, who was a great Rama Bhakta, was a disciple of Upanishad Brahmayogin, the renowned scholar, who is the only known person to have made a commentary on all 108 Upanishads. How cool is that!

And for extra knowledge, the forefather of Carnatic music, was the renowned Haridasa pandit, Purandara Dasa, who was a great Dvaitin and Narayana Bhakta.

Now here are some things I know (you can correct me if I am wrong):

1. The word in Rig Vedas is ARYA not ARYAN. 

2. The word ARYAN was actually first mentioned much later in Behistun Inscription where the word means Iranian/Persian 

Now I have read the Rig Vedas has 10 books called Mandalas so can can anybody tell me which mandalas actually contain mentions of Arya people and link me up with some good English translation of it (I want a translation and explanation done or at least approved by authentic scholars).

I started reading about the kuru dynasty kings. Consider the 2 children of Satyavati and Santanu. Chitrangada died due to fighting with a Gandhara with the same name. He in my knowledge did not do anything bad, didn't have any bad karma. Why did he lose that fight and die? 

Secondly consider the case of Vichitravirya. He got married and was filled with lust and died after spending 7 years with his wife of tuberculosis. He neglected his duties as a king, but did he really do anything bad in his life to die? 

Consider the case of Bhishma. He did do se eral wrong things in his life like not defending Draupadi and participating in the wrong side of the war. But when he asked Krisha why he was suffering so much on his bed of arrows, he was shown what he did on his past life and what he did to that chameleon or snake in one of his past life. 

Now, some of the sources are probably not from Vyasa Mahabharata. I was reading them from the internet. So plz tell me from Vyasa Mahabharata why didn't karma work for them? 

Edit: I also want to know what draupadi did to almost get disrobed and humiliated like that? I mean in some versions she mocked Duryodhana but in the original Vyasa Mahabharata I think she was totally innocent. 

Edit 2: What did Abhimanyu do to die like that? 

I know all of them are for the progress of the story and for actual evil guys to get karma but according to Hinduism, if they didn't do bad things, it shouldn't happen to them. ",11,True,Question - Beginner,,1.0,False,Question - Beginner

I lost my only brother in September, and with Bhai Dooj approaching, I'm struggling to find peace. For the upcoming Bhaidooj and Rakshabandhan, pls suggest if there is a way to honour him…is there anything I can do to send my love, wishes, and prayers to him, perhaps through a special pooja or ritual that could reach his soul? How can I celebrate this day in a way that brings comfort and connection with him?

For the past few years, I believe I have angered the Gods or done something wrong. 

I discussed this with my father and one morning I asked him to talk to our family astrologer, who said Rahu and Shani are heavy in my chart for a while and it will be like this till next year. 

From childhood, I never really felt any strong connection to any particular god, I would worship whoever my parents would do pujas for (Shiv ji, Laxmi Ma, Hanuman ji and Durga Ma). When I was 16 I started reading about Saraswati Ma and felt very connected. I always thought she'd bless me with knowledge and creative talent, however despite trying very hard, I haven't been successful in whatever I do. 

I feel like whatever I do, God isn't letting it happen. I am not blaming God or anyone, just to be clear. For a while I thought all of my gods who I worshipped hated me, but then I realised more than hatred they are indifferent to my existence, which hurt even more. That no matter how much I thank them, think of them, they probably will never hear my cries or pleas or prayers. 

I'm so lost, I don't want to stop believing in God. ",5,True,Question - Beginner,,0.84,False,Question - Beginner

*Yudhishthira said, 'Who are those persons, O Bharata, from whom a Brahmana in this world may accept his food? From whom may a Kshatriya, a Vaisya, and a Sudra take their food respectively?'*

\*Bhishma said, '\****A Brahmana may take his food from another Brahmana or from a Kshatriya or a Vaisya, but he must never accept food from a Sudra. A Kshatriya may take his food from a Brahmana, a Kshatriya or a Vaisya.*** *He must, however,* ***eschew food given by Sudras who are addicted to evil ways and who partake of all manner of food without any scruple. Brahmanas and Kshatriyas can partake of food given by such Vaisyas as tend the sacred fire every day, as are faultless in character, and as perform the vow of Chaturmasya.***

***But the man who takes food from a Sudra, swallows the very abomination of the earth, and drinks the excretions of the human body, and partakes of the filth of all the world.*** *He partakes of the very filth of the earth who takes his food thus from a Sudra.* ***Verily, those Brahmanas that take their food from Sudras, take the dirt of the earth. If one engages in the service of a Sudra, one is doomed to perdition though one may duly perform all the rites of one's order.*** *A Brahmana, a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, so engaging, is doomed, although devoted to the due performance of religious rites. It is said that a Brahmana's duty consists in studying the Vedas and seeking the welfare of the human race; that a Kshatriya's duty consists in protecting men, and that a Vaisya's in promoting their material prosperity.*

*A Vaisya lives by distributing the fruits of his own acts and agriculture. The breeding of kine and trade are the legitimate work in which a Vaisya may engage without fear of censure. The man who abandons his own proper occupation and betakes himself to that of a Sudra, should be considered as a Sudra and on no account should any food be accepted from him.* ***Professors of the healing art, mercenary soldiers, the priest who acts as warder of the house, and persons who devote a whole year to study without any profit, are all to be considered as Sudras***\*. And those who impudently partake of food offered at ceremonials in a Sudra's house are afflicted with a terrible calamity.\*

*In consequence of partaking such forbidden food they lose their family, strength, and energy, and attain to the status of animals, descending to the position of dogs, fallen in virtue and devoid of all religious observances.* ***He who takes food from a physician takes that which is no better than excrement; the food of a harlot is like urine; that of a skilled mechanic is like blood.*** ***If a Brahmana approved by the good, takes the food of one who lives by his learning, he is regarded as taking the food of a Sudra.*** *All good men should forego such food. The food of a person who is censured by all is said to be like a draught from a pool of blood.* ***The acceptance of food from a wicked person is considered as reprehensible as the slaying of a Brahmana***\*.\*

*One should not accept food if one is slighted and not received with due honours by the giver. A Brahmana, who does so, is soon overtaken by disease, and his race soon becomes extinct. By accepting food from the warder of a city, one descends to the status of the lowest outcaste.* ***If a Brahmana accepts food from one who is guilty of killing either a cow or a Brahmana or from one who has committed adultery with his preceptor's wife or from a drunkard, he helps to promote the race of Rakshasas.*** *By accepting food from a eunuch, or from an ungrateful person, or from one who has misappropriated wealth entrusted to his charge, one is born in the country of the Savaras situated beyond the precincts of the middle country.*

*I have thus duly recited to thee the persons from whom food may be accepted and from whom it may not. Now tell me, O son of Kunti, what else thou wish*est to hear from me today.'

I am not asking for a „scientific” Jung related explanation, just a genuine thought about this from people, who are Hinduists for a little longer.

So, I had this colleague who is a believer, she follows a certain Guru. She actually was the one who brought me on this path as I am a person who is genuinely very curious. She has gifted me a Bhagavad Gita. But this is just the beginning.

As the time passes, I have found myself writing a MA thesis about Hinduism and its relationship to philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. I have watched online darshans with said guru, listened to mantra sang by him, almost on daily basis I was learning new things. 

Now, a month later, when I stopped watching or thinking about this guru and even did not look into any books nor listened to mantra (but I still occasionally chant it), I had a dream, where the Guru has given me a blessing. What is weird to me is that this did not happen when I was in the “you’re thinking about it way too much” era - I did not have these dreams during the intense studies, nor when I got firstly interested in Hinduism. 

Is this a way of being blessed? 

To explain why am I doing a little less now - I am still trying to find my path in this world. I also have been through very bad times made by people faithful to the Christian god, which is making me question my own beliefs even more.

Be it men or women. I have a suspicious lack of true friends in my life. All I have got is my childhood friends, and even they continuously elude me. Not involving me in their plans, not missing me when I am absent, perhaps even talking behind my back. 

During this past Navratri, I realised how they weren't my true friends. A bunch of girls showed up with them for Garba, and they wouldn't pay me any mind. I was kind of going through a rough patch in life at that time (still am), and they didn't even ask me if I was okay. I cried myself to sleep through a few days. And I rarely cry.  

Every attempt I have engaged in to find new friends, I have found that they never prioritise me over the other trivial things going on in their lives. The biggest point of contention for me is women. All my friends that have known me since long, and who I have financially sacrificed a lot for have effortlessly left me behind for pretty girls. That really pisses me off. Somedays I feel like spending some time with those friends, only to find out that they are spending time with some random women out there. The occasional time that they do spend with me is spent talking about things that do not interest me. I eventually leave the meetings, with them paying my departure no mind.

This has been going on for years, and now I am convinced that a higher power is at play, continuously bringing me pain and loneliness. I had quit smoking a few months back, but I have picked it up again and it's even more intense than before. 

I have tried to get into dating as well to try and find that someone special who I could talk to and always rely on, only to have that fall flat on my face just as well.

The thing is, I feel like I don't deserve this loneliness and pain. Has anyone else experienced this after becoming spiritual? What could Lord Krishna be thinking?

I am proper  Hindu. But the more I delve in the religion, I realise I am more aligned with the philosophy of God, existence, good and bad rather than everything scriptural word by word. I wanna learn and know about everything but I am not interested in following everything. Aisa toh hai nahi ki har scriptures vedo ki tarah important ya literal hai. Most of our scriptures are literary and more ethic morality based stories rather than actual happening. While I believe Lord Ram and krishna existed, I don't take the whole story to be very literal and consider the supernatural part as way of literary caricature of happening. Uske upar yk like sabke traditions and cultures in our religion are different due to different origin and understanding of the world and faith but still hold very much common grounds. Hamara religion never had a prophet but several pre Vedic societies brought under same discipline of Sanatana. Humare scriptures in different societies are also practiced differently but somehow everyone seems to act as if being a religious super traditional northern vegetarian Hindu is the only right way. Most of our scriptures are mostly northern so I get it why the influence but is being not very traditional, scriptural really wrong? Like har puran and mythology story thodi na real hogi? Most of purans like shaivism and vaishnavism ka ek dushre ko lekar perception alag alag hai. It's clear that they had personal bias, so why do people act like every thing is God sent and not realise ki most of it is our own human work of literary scholarship. Uske upar the people obsession with manusmriti and jaati system is really disturbing for me. I get why Varna system came to be but jaati is stupid stupid but people defend jaati pratha as if it's some important part of traditions while it is literally human made blunder of our religion. Most of our religion is work of scholars, saints preachers and teachers who with their level of understanding of dharma spread their words. So why this making every single thing as if it is sent by God and should be followed word by word?

 As much as I have read I don't get karmic bad deed for looking at god's as more philosophical and meta physical existence rather than actual beings do I? I believe we all arise from some conscious and god's are just much more closer to the original conscious then us that's why more divine but everyone else with enough penance can also reach that level of connection. Not to say I want that, it's childish to think you can reach God level understanding that easily.... But is being agnostic and not into your culture in form of practice bad, I wanna know my culture but I am not very into practicing all the vrat and festivals. I mostly follow the more important ones in my family. As an agnostic and bisexual if God exists I really want it to be dharmic family not the Abhramic one. The god they believe is more like a tyrant than an actual being of everything. So can I live my more so liberal life or do I really have to be the perfect image of hindu that is spread online.

1gbeylu,Stuck between islam and hinduism,Ominous_chipmunk,2024-10-24 23:16:25+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gbeylu/stuck_between_islam_and_hinduism/,48,/r/hinduism/comments/1gbeylu/stuck_between_islam_and_hinduism/,hinduism,"Hello, Reddit. I used to be an atheist, but I have come to the conclusion that God necessarily exists. The problem comes in discerning which religion or which manifestation of Him is the true one. I just want to do the right thing, serve, and worship God in the most dignified way possible, loving Him with all my heart as He deserves but I need to know which of all the perspectives is the truth.

I'm stuck between two options: Islam and Hinduism. On one hand, Islam (specifically, the sunni sufi branch) seems to me the most reasonable, simple, philosophically and doctrinally precise, and the least loaded with mythology, tales which many might not take as true (I respect them, either if they are true ir just stories) and metaphors. That said, I feel a sense of restriction, a lot of rigidity, almost like doing a chore (but that, to be honest, might be my fault), etc.

On the other hand, although Hinduism is full of mythology and legends, its vision of God, reality and moksha also seems very, very reasonable and accurate to me, symbolism and hypothetic fictions aside. Additionally, while I don't interpret its deities literally (multiple arms, ornaments, jewels, their legends and mythology, etc.), I underdand that they represent aspects of One God and their representation and the chants used to praise them/Him (He-His aspects) make me very happy, focused and blissful (especially those of Krishna, Vishnu, and Shiva). Personally, the idea of Krishna or Vishnu as the supreme deity (God with a capital ""G""), with Shiva and the rest being His manifestations, satisfies me rationally. However, the idea of reincarnation both 'depresses' and terrifies me, although singing the names of Krishna, Shiva, Vishnu, etc. brings me great happiness, just like when I pray to Allah. Nevertheless, with Hinduism I feel less grounded and less stability. Because of reincarnation (until Moksha/freedom) it feels more diffuse and blurred. Islam makes me feel more grounded and solid, so to speak. I dont pick based on the final afterlife result: Moksha (whatever the type —it seems to vary as regards Vasihnavism, Shaivism or ISCKON—) or Heaven/Paradise. I just stand for the truth. 

It reaches a point where I believe what both traditions (Muslim and Hindu) say, but even though Islam seems more rational to me and I feel bliss, security and a direct connection with Allah (God), I am also greatly attracted to Hinduism and I do not know why. At the same time, although Hinduism common points make a lot of sense to me, I am terrified of reincarnation, of being wrong, and of offending Allah by being led by imagination (loving Krishna as my brother —I am only child and always longed for one—, my son, a friend, etc., for example. Its a devotional practice, if I am not mistaken), or by the experiences of ecstasy, bliss, love for Krishna, peace, relationship with him (Krishna) and joy in meditation as regards Hinduism. Worshipping others besides Allah completely aware is unforgivable by God (Allah) in islam and I feel guilty and scared but when I switch to islam, Krishna and Shiva seem to invite me, participate, love and worship them. But then the loneliness of reincarnation and the security which islam seem to bring strikes me. I cant resist the love and friendship of Krishna and its manifestations (I think my mind aligns with Vasihnavism) and the joy of Hindu tradition. The issue is that in Hinduism there is only One Supreme God (as in islam) but He can be incarnated (avatars) as Jesus and artistically represented, which is a hideous unforgivable blasphemy in islam. 

I think about this so much and go in circles to the point where my head hurts, and I often get depressed because I feel stuck. What do you think I should do in this situation? It's a constant battle between fear, reason, happiness, and emptiness. I'm going crazy. What do you suggest? I just Want to do the right thing and love God. But I feel torn by both right and left EXTREME opposites.

My luck in terms of my career seems to be stagnating

I am being very specific here - career luck seems to be stagnating. I'm saying this because I consider myself lucky in other aspects - I have great parents, decent family life, decent financial stability but a below average job. 

Why I am saying a below average career - I have double masters and my business school was one of the top B schools in the US. I enrolled in the the school looking at the career prospects after graduating with MBA. However, my career did not skyrocket at all and continued to grow at a snails pace whereas some of my colleagues are already Directors, Sr. Directors and some are even partners at consulting companies earning millions.

I have worked equally hard. I did my MBA while working full time and I remember having 16 hours days because 10 hours were at work, 6 hours studying, preparing for interviews etc. But I didn't get a good opportunity during my graduation unlike my peers. Even after graduation, it's been a very steep climb. Last week I was almost about to clear my final interview round at a big tech company when they informed me that they went ahead with an internal candidate. This is happening way too often to a point where I am thinking it's some kind of a pattern and indication from the universe that this isn't for me.

I have always been an achiever throughout except my professional success in the last 10 years of my life. I have a feeling that the only thing I can really do is accept the fate

After watching and reflecting on it, I have come to realise that my Self, my Atma is the consciousness - Turiyam. I have seen my body age, I am aware that my mind has grown, from the knowledge and experience now my mind knows a lot of things, has a lot of feelings and because of this changing world, it is conditioned to behave, feel in some ways, and the fact that I know and am aware of my changing mind that I is actually Me.

was I supposed to know this so directly? Because from my experience Bhagavad Gita takes us there very gradually. While I understood what the Bhagavad Gita explained, I did not have this clarity, now this clarity so clear that I feel weird about it. As if it was lying out there and I couldn't notice it. It's too direct, like someone preaching something and now that I understood what they're trying to say I also see some truth to it and can't deny it. My mind's nature is to question things, I like to be real but also turning spiritual, but this is so direct there's no room for thinking more about it, it's purely intellectual and not complete devotion or surrender.

I am 20, doing job and near my workplace, there is Hanuman temple where I go daily to do Pooja and Jaap. The temple is managed by an old couple, who as far as I know don't have children and are not able to work due to their age.

Yesterday, I visited and the couple has a conversation with me. They told that the temple is running by what people put near the idol, which is very less for them to buy Prasad,  Ghee and special flowers which we make for Hanuman Dada.

They said they can't ask students, but they are requesting people who are earning to donate whatever they can or want to atleast buy basic things for Temple. People sometimes barely put coins or neither they help at all. Let alone I didn't even get to the point of their expenses.

I tried to donate as much as can from my side, but due to my small salary, I had to hold myself back because I also have to manage my expenses. I thought of sharing it here, because I can help them before this New Year. I know it sounds a bit off, also there can be hesitation, I too hesitated to post this here.


I am requesting on behalf of that couple to donate whatever amount you want to donate (1,10,20,50). Whatever the amount is collected, 100% of that plus my little contribution will go to that temple. I know it sounds fishy and untrustworthy, but I feel very bad for the temple and couple.

Context: A couple of years ago, I was known for my Hindu artworks on this subreddit. However, after starting college, I had to stop creating art and thus my earnings also stopped.

Recently, moving to a new city for an internship in my 4th semester has drained my limited funds completely. I was hoping to continue the internship as a full-time job, but my college isn't allowing it, which has left me in a very difficult situation. I’m now stuck between ruining my career and ending my life as I have no funds left to sustain my expenses on the campus.

To sustain myself for the remaining six months of college, I’m looking to sell all my existing artworks. I’m offering the original versions and their intellectual rights as a way to express my gratitude for any support I receive.

If any of you are still interested in my artworks and would like to own the original pieces, please reach out to me. It would mean a lot for me.

So I'm currently reading Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana and came acrose this Shloka in Baalkanda where Sri Narad Ji recites Ramayana in brief to Maharishi Valmiki Ji.
The shloka is प्रेषणं वायु पुत्रस्य भारतेन समागम |
राम अभिषेक अभ्युदयं सर्व सैन्य विसर्जनम् |
स्व राष्ट्र रंजनम् च एव वैदेह्यः च विसर्जनम् || 1-3-38 

हनुमान को भरत से मिलने भेजना, क्योंकि उन्होंने प्रतिज्ञा की थी कि यदि राम समय पर नहीं आए तो वे आत्मदाह कर लेंगे; राम का राज्याभिषेक महोत्सव; वानरों की सभी सैन्य टुकड़ियों को वापस भेज देना; राम द्वारा अपनी प्रजा की प्रसन्नता के लिए राज्य चलाना, तथा उनकी ही प्रसन्नता के लिए वैदेहनंदिनी सीता को भी वन में त्याग देना । 

Now I'm aware of the debate of Bhagwan Sri Rama leaving Mata Sita being in Valmiki Ramayana but here in Balkanda it states that.
So please I request all of you learned individuals here to help me understand if this incident actually happened or not. Will appreciate your response.

I believe that ISKCON has Krishna as the Godhead rather than Brahman as described in the Upanishads.  I don't wish to comment on this or stir this up so please know I mean no offense in this regard, but this is the foundation of my question.

My question is, it appears to me that ISKCON is a form of Advaita Vedanta in the sense that Krishna is both deity AND the all encompassing One or Source, as described in the Bhagavad Gita.  I think that ISKCON is considered a monastic school in Hinduism too.  So, is it the former, latter or both?  I'm asking because I am hammering out my beliefs and I feel like I am getting somewhere with it after so many years of swimming in the ocean of Sanatana Dharma.

I am an Indian Hindu, and I am very devotional about my faith. I wanted to explore how other religions discuss their gods and the origins of life. A doubt occurred to me: Is everything about our religion historical, or is it written with exaggeration?

For example, Christianity mentions that Jesus existed around 2000 years ago. The story appears to be about actual people who were Jews.

Islam similarly recounts the story of Prophet Muhammad and Adam, which is comparable to Christianity.

However, Hindu scriptures mention Lord Rama as having existed around 7000 years ago—an astounding claim, considering how historically inaccurate it might seem. Some texts even suggest the Ramayana took place 1.6 million years ago, which is an extraordinary number. The stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata mention flying vehicles and concepts like time agnosticity (e.g., Kalki, the crow), as well as the communication between Sanjaya and Dhritarashtra. Some technologies described in these texts are things we don’t even have today.

Is it possible that these were written as exaggerations? I am just a curious mind. I apologize if I inadvertently hurt anyone’s sentiments. Please correct me if any of my understanding is incorrect.",39,True,Hindū Scripture(s),,0.55,False,Hindū Scripture(s)

1g9kvrs,why God doesn't come to help you?

Why Bhagwaan let so many people suffer and never comes to help. But you forget the most important thing. You must see within yourself first, do you have firm steadfast belief in Bhagwan?      
      
       
Learn to blame yourself. Instead of raising questions at God. Unless you blame yourself for everything, God will never come to help you. So when does Bhagwan come to help you? Only if you have utmost firm belief in God like Prahlaada.     
     
      
Hiranyakashipu was father of Prahlada, who asked to destroy all Vishnu temples and kill all Vishnu worshipers. Hiranyakashipu and his army killed all the innocent worshippers of Vishnu. But still Hiranyakashipu and his army couldn't kill Prahlada. Why did Vishnu not help hundreds of thousands of innocent worshippers getting killed by Hiranyakashipu and his servants, but only helped Prahlaada?       
      
         

Because only Prahlaada had utmost firm belief in Vishnu. Bhagwaan Vishnu was taking test of devotees in form of injustice of Hiranyakashipu, and those innocent worshippers gave up and their belief in God was shattered. This is why Vishnu let them be killed at hands of Hiranyakashipu. But Prahlaada on the other hand, was steadfast in belief of Vishnu, therefore Vishnu saved him from any kind of problems. And Prahlada became one of the most prominent Bhaktas (devotees) of Vishnu.       
         
        
So your belief in Bhagwaan should be like this. Completely firm. Remember, this world is ultimately Bhagwaan itself, and there is no wrong or right, justice or injustice. Because Paramatma cannot differentiate between good and bad, at all. A sinner who harms and troubles others is completely equal for God as is a pious virtuous person who helps and protects others, because God lacks ability to differentiate between wrong and right. So for God, there is no difference between a wrong doer and right doer. So before blaming God, you should look into yourself. Only then can you realise the shining Bhagwaan residing within your consciousness. Until you overcome Maya of Bhagwaan, you can never attain Bhagwan ji. So keep chanting the nectar like most divine powerful name of Bhagwan who is always present, only when you remember Bhagwan with true mind, then only you will get Darshana. Otherwise, God will never come for you. So be completely true mind, completely fully true, and you will get darshan of Bhagwan ji. And if you don't then your Bhakti is weak, you love of God is not true, and real. So make your Bhakti and mind completely true, then you will get darshan of Bhagwan ji.",21,True,Other,,0.82,False,Other

done. Quranic/Islamic studies, though not as prominent as biblical studies, is a also a somewhat mature field, with many papers being published on anachronomisms within the Quran, analysis of reliability of Hadith, etc. Such studies are scientific in nature and the academics often do not belong to the same religion as the texts they are analyzing.

I belong to the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya of Sheshavatara Bhagavan Ramanujacharya, and Sri Ramayanam is the one of the MOST important Granthas of our Sampradaya. No Sampradaya has given as much importance to Sri Ramayanam as Us Sri Vaishnavas, to explain the concept of Sharnagati to Perumal. 

Here are some resources which have refuted Neo-Hindu claims of Uttara Kanda being interpolated with proper proof:

I consider myself a spiritual person—I read the Ramayana, Bhagavad-Gita, and other scriptures, but one thing I rarely do is puja or sadhana. I don’t engage in regular worship or spiritual practices.

What’s worse is that I only seem to remember God when I’m in trouble or desperately need something. When life is going smoothly, I often forget. But when I’m facing a crisis, that’s when I start praying or remembering Him. This makes me feel deeply guilty. It feels selfish to only seek God’s presence when I need help, and that thought stops me from praying even when I’m in a crisis.

Instead of reaching out in those moments, I tell myself, ""How bad of me to only remember God now. I don’t deserve to ask for anything."" Then I just stop praying altogether, thinking I should accept whatever life gives me as the result of my karma.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with the guilt of remembering God only when you’re in need? I’d appreciate any advice or insights.",5,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

Namaste. I'm an average Hindu who takes part in rituals and also believes in our devatā-s.

I'm also a firm believer in the Aryan Migration Theory ( AMT ).

A few months back I started reading stuff said by white indologists where they stated that Lord Kṛṣṇa as an historical figure was ""Non-Aryan"" because of his dark skin.

Got really confused after all this. After a month or two I came across amazing blogs run by Hindus who are also believers of the AMT and are geniuses when it comes to the Ārya Vedic tradition and the history of Sanātana Dharma.

 things which i learnt from them were :

1 - Kṛṣṇa was a prince of the Yadu Clan , one of the 5 Ṛgvedic lunar Ārya Clans ( Alongside Turvasu , Pūru , Anu and Druhyu )

2 - The Sub-clan of the Yadu-s to which Kṛṣṇa is said to have hailed from : The Sātvata-s are mentioned in the Śruti. The Ṛgvedic Aitereya Brāhmaṇa mentions them (Satvat-s ) as being South ( Probably South of the Kuru-s ) i.e the modern day Braj region. the Śukla Yajurvedīya Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa mentions that the Bharata-s seized the Aśvamedha horse of the Satvat-s , confirming that the Yādava Satvat-s were Indo-Āryans who followed the Vedic faith.

3 - Now Kṛṣṇa's skin colour. Well there's no doubt about him being dark complexioned. But we need to understand that the Ārya-s did afterall mix with the Locals. And he is not the only one who was Dark-complexioned. Drauapdī - the princess of Pañchāla ( one of the 2 centers of Vedic culture )was also Dark complexioned.

4 - By the time of the Mahābhārata , the Yadu-s had many sub-clans : The Satvat-s , Vṛṣṇis , Andhakas , Bhojas , Daśārhas , Madhu's etc.. . Kṛṣṇa was the first cousin of the Pāṇḍavas : Princes of the Kuru Dynasty.

Well I have alot more to say on this topic but I'll stop here as I think all this might bore alot of people.

So I'll end with saying that skin colour might have been a identification marker for the early Ārya-s but as many generations passed , they undoubtedly mixed with local tribes and also tanned ( bcs of the subcontinent's weather ).

Also , if you don't believe in the Aryan Migration/invasion theory , that's completely fine ! Everyone is free to have their own opinion , a thing i love about my religion and culture.

If anyone wants to add something to this or if anyone is interested in the history of the Yadu clan and Kṛṣṇa or if you have any info or remark regarding my post , please comment !

1g9bkp9,Ashrama system has to be the most contradictory thing to ever exist in Hinduism. ,black_hustler3,2024-10-22 07:19:21+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g9bkp9/ashrama_system_has_to_be_the_most_contradictory/,0,/r/hinduism/comments/1g9bkp9/ashrama_system_has_to_be_the_most_contradictory/,hinduism,"Hindu scriptures are unanimous about Dharma Artha Kama and Moksha as the fundamental path of life for every human. They say It is necessary to go through Artha and Kama to be able to finally attain Moksha but then there are also verses in numerous scriptures that indulgence into Wealth and Lust increases it further and that It can never be satisfied.

I don't really understand that If Wealth and Lust restrain humans from liberation by binding them to their materialistic pleasures, why do they precede the ultimate goal when most people are led astray after their indulgence into both and are dead long before they have the luxury to pursue Moksha?

Are they trying to merely justify the indulgence into Wealth and Lust in the pretext of 'I am doing all this because I want to attain Moksha eventually'

And what's more problematic is the Moksha part is left for the end when one is inching towards his death.
How could liberation be so cheap when you
spent your prime years in attaining Artha and Kama, that you now expect to so easily attain Moksha with that decrepit body and mind of yours in old age?

I have been practicing Hinduism for a while now, but only recently have started attending satsang at my local temple. I find it to be a very powerful experience, providing me the opportunity to connect with God and with other people who share my religion, but I’m not entirely sure how I fit in to the practice of temple worship.

I am non-binary, and this presents some challenges in the environment of a temple, where certain rules apply for men vs. women. Men sit in the front, women sit in the back. Men may speak to the priest, women may not. Even where one puts shoes, and where one enters the temple is dictated by gender. Dress is also a bit tricky – as much as I want my attention to be fully on devotion to the divine, wearing feminine clothing to align with my assigned gender at birth causes me to feel dysphoric, and the intense panic this causes distracts me. I know I need to separate myself from my body, but dysphoria is proving to be a hinderance rather than a help in this endeavor – it causes me to overly focus on my physical appearance rather than be able to ignore it.

There is another wrinkle in this, which is that I am white, and do not come from an Indian culture. Everyone at the temple has been very welcoming, encouraging, and kind to me as I have explored and learned, but it is very clear that I am still an outsider. I am worried that, if they learned I exist in this space between man and woman, I would no longer have a community.

I feel stuck. I either have to be dishonest while I worship at the temple, endure some pretty nasty dysphoria, and keep secrets from people who have been so kind to me, or I reveal my identity, am honest while I worship, and no longer have to deal with dysphoria, but I risk no longer having a community. What should I do? Should I tell someone, or should I stay in the closet?",2,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General
1g8hkkb,Significance of burning firecrackers in Deepavali ,,2024-10-21 05:29:28+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g8hkkb/significance_of_burning_firecrackers_in_deepavali/,12,/r/hinduism/comments/1g8hkkb/significance_of_burning_firecrackers_in_deepavali/,hinduism,"21/10/2024

So Deepavali is in few days. Amavasya Tithi is going to start from 3:52 PM on 31st October to 6:16 PM on 1st November. I hope you and your family have planned well for the coming occasion. I wish that you find prosperity in your new ventures and your relations become better and peace and spirituality surround you.

Well, another thing which comes around Deepavali is the sudden concern of environmentalists for noise and sound pollution. Personally, I would recommend you to keep these things in mind while buying firecrackers:

1. Buy Indian brands only
2. Buy CSIR-NEERI-certified green logo fireworks only
3. Light and show are always more pleasing than sound and smoke
4. Don't misuse the firecrackers and harm anyone or anything
5. Manage your finances better, firecrackers are good but so are lights, sweets and rangolis

And also, for those who are saying that firecrackers aren't there in the culture of Deepavali,

**Skanda Purana Verse** [**2.4.9.65**](http://2.4.9.65)

**तुलासंस्थे सहस्रांशौ प्रदोषे भूतदर्शयोः ।**  
**उल्काहस्ता नराः कुर्युः पितॄणां मार्गदर्शनम् ॥ ६५ ॥**

When the Sun is in the sign of Libra and Pradosha has gone yesterday, people hold ""Ulkaa"" in their hand to guide their ancestors.

Though Ulkaas of then are different from fire crackers of today, but we can say that it is our culture, not some foreign influence. But at the same time, though there is no bad intention in our religion, poisons do exist as made by corporates for profits.

So, enjoy Deepavali, with pride, spirituality and responsibility.",0,True,Hindū Festival,festival,1.0,False,Hindū Festival

I've seen an increasing number of Shakta users on this sub and I've been receiving many repetitive queries. To help everyone here is some basic information that anyone interested in Shakta Sampradaya Should review.

# Tantra

Unlike the popular perception ""Tantra"" refers to revealed texts where Shiva/Bhairava is speaking with Shakti/Bhairavi. These texts are critical in current Shakta practices because most Shakta worship is outlined in these texts. Some texts commonly confused with Tantras are *Damar* (Shakti speaking with Shiva), Yamala (Both speaking with each other), Shaiva Agama, and Shakta Agama. Those Shakta practices that come from tantras are referred to as *Tantric/Tantrokata* and those that come from Puranas are *Pauranic/Laukik*.

# Vidya

Mantras for Devi are known as Vidyas.

# Mahavidya

The ""great vidya"" or the great mantras. Dasha Mahavidyas are 10 mantras that can grant liberation to the practitioner. But just like Dasha Avatars of Vishnu, various lists of 10 mantras are accepted in different sects. Moreover, there are more than 10 mahavidyas, some sources even speak of 7 Crore Mahavidyas. The popular 10 are:

1. Maa Kali
2. Maa Tara
3. Maa Lalita
4. Maa Bhuvaneshwari
5. Maa Tripura Bhairavi
6. Maa Chinnamastika
7. Maa Dhumavati
8. Maa Baglamukhi
9. Maa Matangi
10. Maa Kamala

Though these forms are referred to as Mahavidya, technically their specific mantras are the Mahavidyas. In the Shakta understanding, there is no difference between the mantra and the deity. Some of the above forms are quite secretive and it is unwise to reveal many details about them. For Example, Maa Chinnamastika is a closely guarded secret, her mantra may only be given to someone after several decades of practice. Some of these forms are also propitiated for pryogas and abhichar (to be discussed). For Example, Maa Baglamukhi is associated with Stambhana Shakti and invoked by many for very materialistic causes.

# Kula

Kulas are families of tantric lineages. A kula worships the same form of Devi as the supreme, using the tantras taught within the Kula. For Example: For in Kali Kula, Maa Kali is the supreme form of Maa and all other devis are her swaroopas, their worship is based on Tantras like Brihad Neela Tantra. Currently, Kali Kula and Sri (Maa Lalita Tripura Sundari) Kula are two of the most dominant Kulas, most shaktas will fall in either of these two. Outside of these families are uninitiated practitioners who worship in the pauranic mode. Amongst the uninitiated Maa Durga is the most commonly worshipped form. (Sad Note: Durga Kula was systematically decimated under the Mughals and has few practitioners.)

# Aacharam

Aacharam refers to the mode of worship. There are 7 aacharams:

* **Dakshinachar**: Dakshin means right (hence the right-hand path). Rules in Dakshinachar are very similar to that in Pauranic worship and the samagri used is satvik.
* **Samayachar**: Samaya is a higher form of Dakshinachar. In this mode, no samagri is used and worship is purely done mentally accompanied by mantras.
* **Vamachar**: Vama means left (hence the left-handed path). It is opposite to normal forms of worship. This is the path where the infamous Pancha makar (discussed in detail later) comes in. Vamachar is one of the most misunderstood forms of Shakta worship. Most discussions around it on the internet are misguided.
* **Veerachar**: This is a more intense form of Vamachar. Samagri becomes very strange and practices are done in cremation grounds or secluded places. A true Veerachar Sadhak coming online to speak of these practices is rare and honestly not expected.
* **Mishrachar**: Mix between Dakshin and Vama practices
* **Kaulachar**: More intense version of Samaya and Veera practices. What exactly is kaulachar is open to interpretation and various masters from Bhaskara Raya Makin to Krishnanada Aghavashish have differing views.
* **Divyachar:** This aacharam is the highest state reached by any practitioner. Identification with the deity is so strong every action becomes worship.

# Prayoga and Abhichar

Both refer to the application of power generated through the mantra sadhana. Shakta practices are unique in this aspect. While most other sects would use mantra shakti purely for spiritual gains, in Shakta practices it is very much possible to apply mantra shakti to help with materialistic problems. This application is known as prayoga **if and only if the deity grants explicit permission**. If permission from the deity is not there it is known as **Abhichar**. Six/eight prayogas are there:

1. **Shanti:** creating peace
2. **Pushti:** creating prosperity \[*Subset of Shanti*\]
3. **Vidveshan:** creating conflict
4. **Mohana:** attracting an entity
5. **Vashikarana:** controlling an entity \[*Subset of Mohana*\]
6. **Stambhana:** Stopping the natural flow of something
7. **Uchhatan:** forcing an entity to leave
8. **Marana:** killing an entity

This aspect of the practice is interpreted variously, for general knowledge I have only provided the generic meaning of these terms. It is important to know that both these terms are controversial and each lineage has a slightly different understanding. For example, in my lineage, such practices are meant to be applied internally to help in faster spiritual progress only. But some lineages do apply these to external issues.

# The 5 Ms

One of the most controversial aspects of Vamachar practices. On a literal level, 5Ms are:

1. **Madya**: Alcohol
2. **Matsya**: Fish
3. **Mamsa**: Meat
4. **Mudra**: Grain
5. **Maithun**: Intercourse

Needless to say, some lineages don't take these literally. Madya is interpreted to mean ecstasy of Japa, Matsya is pranayama, Mamsa is dhyana, Mudra is actions, and Maithuna is the union of Kundalini with Sahasrhara Chakra. There are, however lineages that perform these rites literally as well.

This is the first post in a series of posts aimed at dispelling unnecessary confusion regarding these practices and terms. As usual, leaving questions in the comments would help everyone. My DMs remain open to all, but since I've been getting repetitive queries I feel it is better to address them here.

But my question comes from a place of curiosity and not orthodoxy.

As a child ,I don't remember from whom exactly, I had heard that each yuga corresponds with one of the four varnas － that is, satyug is the age of knowledge (bramhins), treta the age of valour and power (kshtriya), dwapar the age of commerce (vaisya), and kalyug the age of iron age, the age of labour (shudra). That is not to say one yuga is inherently better than the other (which is another conversation altogether) － if I remember correctly that person said that this theory was put forth by Swami Vivekanand.
However, I have gone through numerous quotes and speeches by Swami Vivekanand and I haven't found the evidence for this.

If any of you knows anything about this theory then please comment or dm me, I am really interested in this and looking forward to learn more.",1,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

Hello. I feel like there are two parts of my brain. One hindu and one the old confused one. The old one used to call the kathas of the pastimes of gods as stories and fictions with philosophical meaning while the hindu one sees lord krishna as everything. You can call the old one the epitome of gen z. While a small child I was very devotional but as I grew up in my preteens my own shortcomings (those according to hinduism) and my environment took me away. I felt forced to criticize religion because my slight interest in science in childhood turned into a loveless obsession for science in my teens. Currently the new me says that science and technology isn't important because limited knowledge of this material is enough. What is really necessary is peace harmony and knowledge of life and rights and that is what hinduism gives. I was also tempted by the well managed, clean, technological side of the western world (according to what i saw in that age) and I associated that to their religion. so i strayed from my original path of hinduism the one that I belong to. So nowadays I can't do bhakti properly because my old immature arguements still come in my mind and I cant stop it. I also have a problem. I see images and have another type of thought, lets call it energy for now.  The statements my old self said about hinduism still comes to my mind and that creates an energy of irreligion which tries to pull me away from hinduism. I cant watch western content nowadays because the energy of western faith pulls me. I cant study anything in my school because the energy of modern academia and science pulls me away. I was a decent student before and my current self could utilize it better. Now I know that the only purpose education serves me is getting a job and fullfilling my karma and completing my responsibilities towards my family. But back then I was impressed by science and  didn't know the importance of a guru. So i used my own unconventional obsessive ways to learn science which put too much pressure in my mind. I tried to be purely scientific back then and completly rejected religion, ethics, morales. I used immature logic. I used immature buddhi which hadn't seen the light of god. My theories were of charwak types. I used to think self service was the only virtue. I used to think that I should serve myself and make myself happy and there was nothing as rules and virtue . I would argue desparately to save that theory and use obssesive means such as chanting the same sentence over and over again to reinforce it in me. I desperately tried to increase intelligence and scientific aptitude but now I realize that virtue and god are more important than that. I was over expressive and used to over exaggerate things. My life was in complete tamas. I would spend all time in the useless never- satisfying worldly pleasures. I used to magnificantly express my pain and tried to get others acceptance that I was in pain. I was extremely sexual and commited some sexual misdeeds. Now i accept what acharya prasanth said. If there is a river bathe in it dont question where it came from. But I used to overthink in unnecessary matters. I dont know surely but there was a hidden need to be all knowing in me. I delibarately didn't exercise and rejected pranayams because I chanted to myself that intelligence is necessary and not body. But I now know that body is also important and the body is the sadhan for dharma. However the old tendencies still come as energies and memories and attack me. I still kind of return to those tendencies and I have to deny them by extreme force. While exerting this force I am in a very bad state and this has troubled my parents greatly. Even when I am writing about my past self it feels like it is returning and I have to write counter statements that prove the old self wrong to remind myself. I nowadays think I was a dysfunctioning aatma because I could never work all. I would never go in process and go progressively. Back then I always wanted to be perfectly good all of a sudden. I could never stop snacking all day long. If something slightly good happened I would immediately get relaxed and not work instead. I am always concentrating and in some sort of mini-meditation and even if someone sneezes I am greatly disturbed. I again use extreme force and reject this feeling which causes other distress. I want to be below god and serve him and embrace him but sometimes I uncontrolably create stories which makes me look great and above god. The religious part in me. Majority of these problems started when I was 11 some were there since childhood. After I wrote all this about my past I feel like I have returned to my past self again. Before writing this I was remembering lord krishna every moment but as I wrote this I stopped. I was afraid of using notepad for writing this because it reminded me of the energy of the past ( I used to use notepad a lot in the past) when I was a very bad person. Nowadays I don't question culture and religion but in the latest video of acharya prasanth i heard the girl talking about rejecting culture and religion as superstitions which gave me the energy of lack of belief. I want to be a healthy individual and invest my time in doing my karma fullfilling my responsibilities and studying hinduism.

  
I think this gives the gist of the problem I am in. I am very sorry for clumsy writing my mind isn't in the state nowadays for organized writing. Thank you for bearing with my writing and giving some time to read this. Please suggest me what to do.",3,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

We don't believe in creation from nothing. The world existed as potential within Brahman, which is then transformed into gross state by Brahman. 

Mundaka upanishad compares production of the world to a spider producing a spiderweb from itself. The spiderweb already existed within the spider in a subtle state before being made visible. If that was not the case, the spider could have never produced the web. Just like a cockroach can't produce a web, because the cockroach doesn't contain the web within itself in a subtle state.

Whatever you see in the world have always existed within Brahman. They are just transformed from a subtle state to visible state. Something that doesn't exist at all cannot be produced, just like you can't produce a mango tree from an apple seed, because there is no mango tree in the apple seed.

Just a couple of days ago, I found myself in a situation where I couldn’t help but compare myself to others. I saw people around me doing so much better in various aspects—looks, money, and more—and it filled me with anger and frustration. I started questioning why they seem to have it all while I feel stuck.

Hinduism has so many ways of worship and beliefs that I don’t know where to start or whom to believe. I come from a well-to-do family, but we aren’t very affluent or happy, and I have a somewhat dysfunctional family. Whenever I see someone struggling to make ends meet or being treated differently because of their flaws or looks, I feel deeply sad and angry. I often vent to God, questioning what that person did to deserve such treatment. I understand it’s their karma, but I can’t help but wonder where humanity has gone—why is everyone so selfish?

For the past few days, I’ve been feeling disturbed and distracted, making it hard to pray and connect with Lord Hanuman like I usually do. I’m also struggling with distractions from the opposite gender, parties, and material desires. I find myself confused about what’s right and wrong in these areas. Some people say that since Hanuman ji is a Brahmachari, I shouldn’t pursue attraction to the opposite gender, but I’m torn about that as well.

At just 19, I feel I’m too young for all of this. It feels heavy and philosophical compared to my peers, and sometimes I wonder if I should have entered into this level of thinking so soon.

I want to know how to worship effectively and how to find peace of mind amid these feelings. I’ve been seeking answers to a lot of questions, but it feels overwhelming. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you navigate these feelings while maintaining your faith? Any advice or perspectives would be greatly appreciated.

Did he know I would become a devotee one day? 

There are some things going on about in my life. 

The most prominent is my schizophrenia. It has made me extremely unenthused towards life in general. I am so apathetic towards life that I don't react to situations the same way as other people do. I also find it much easier to believe that the world is temporary (much like a simulation) that is engulfed in an illusion that will one day end. The good or bad happenings in the world don't affect me as they used to. 

Second is my severe acne. I believe that my acne has robbed me of my previously good looks, and now I have become below average. I used to be extremely frustrated because of this reason, but now I have started to somehow accept the fact that it is what it is. I used to never want to leave house in the fear of showing my face in public, but now I am getting over that and don't care too much about my looks. I am not vain anymore. 

Third could be my inability to find and hold a job (due to my mental health issues). I do have a job now, but I have found that after a long time of not having one, I have become extremely detached to it. I work honestly, but I don't really care about the money anymore. I am ready to part with any amount of my income or even all of it because it doesn't seem valuable anymore. I guess not having money to spend for the longest time has made me that way. I have kind of learnt to live with the bare minimum. 

Fourth again is my schizophrenia. I have become uninterested in carnal pleasures, like physical and deeper contacts with the opposite gender. I see it only as the means to reproduction. I don't find pleasure in actions i once used to find happiness in, like eating fast food, drinking, sex, video games, touring, sightseeing, etc. 

The thing is though, all my problems started to act up before I became a devotee of Krishna. If Krishna can see into the future and could tell I would become a devotee one day, can I still think of these problems as special arrangements made by Krishna to detach me from the world? 

Or is it all just a general misfortune that has fallen upon me? I truly believe these problems I have faced have helped me get over a lot of materialistic desires.

I hope this post can act as a support for others like us who feel alone, and inspire more discussion. 

I am currently in my 20s and was born into Hinduism. Received the official diagnosis an year ago but I've known my soulmates since we were children. I refer to them as soulmates rather than alters because that's who they are to me. English, Hindi or Sanskrit does not have a word for our relationship. The closest description I can give you is how Shiva is to Shakti but more human (certainly not as divine)

My earliest memory of them goes to when I was 4 years old, the age when our personality starts to develop. In my practice of Hinduism it's considered that a child is a personification of God until age 5, because after the 5th birthday the ego develops . If you do research on DID you find that the distinct identities (or egos) are caused because of severe turbulence and fear in a child's attachment to the people around them. Either way I remember retaining these identities and over time we developed as distinct people

We all have our own relationship with Hinduism. We come from a Brahmin family and our mother is the most devout person I know, her sadhana is on par with several pandits and she is now on the path to actualization. She influenced us very heavily and raised us with these customs. But our path is very different from hers, and even from each other. I personally am following in her guidance and my method of worship is stotras, rituals and meditation - sattvic with some borrowed tantric elements. My soul-sister worships through bhajans and songs. My soul-brother is completely different, in the sense he sees the gods as a friend/parent and speaks to them as such. The one similarity between us all is that our ishta-devata is Devi despite being born into a Vaishnav family. We believe in Shaktism mostly.

Due to our unique situation it is hard to find a guru. I am still not initiated in this path. The only ones who know of us are the gods. They are my gurus.

What I have noticed is that we are treated independent of each other. Like three souls inhabiting one body. I am still in the early stages but I can feel the energies from the dieties and their acknowledgement for each of us is different. They also require unique things from each of us, but have common things we all should do. For example we all chant Devi's stotras every day but I am encouraged to meditate. My soul-sister is encouraged to read the mahakathas

It's interesting but it raises the question - are we treated as seperate people in rituals? It may be straightforward in say a satyanarayana vrat. But what about marriage? Shraddha? I can't find any information in our scriptures. 

Another question is how we came to be. Hinduism so far has no explanation for DID. I can assure you my soulmates are not entities possessing me. It would be hilarious if they were, considering how human we all are. I recall my mother had prayed to the three Mahadevis before my conception - maybe it's that? 

My final question is what would happen to us upon death? Would our karma be judged individually or as part of all of us? Would we integrate into one soul in our future lives before moksha? 

It feels refreshing typing this post because I cannot find such communities online easily. It's easy to lose spirituality when you're like us but we have been connected to it, perhaps because of our past lives. 

Anyways I'd like to hear your thoughts.

I am unable to find its english translation.

Which makes me wonder why would anyone read this scripture in first place if not for this mystic knowledge.

I also found no recitation of this on youtube which is very sad because the sanskrit wordings of this text are the most difficult words I have ever come across and the script used is old hindi as well, not the modern standardized devnagri script.

I only found a south Indian channel teaching about this Samb Panchshika but its in Telugu, which i dont understand.

Regardless, any help on this scripture would be really helpful.

The pollution caused by crackers is a problem really, crackers cause both noise and air pollution + not to mention land pollution when used crackers are not thrown on proper places... 

Diwali is a festival of lights and happiness, lets make it peaceful.. Nature is the best gift of god, we see nature itself as a part of God so why cause harm to it even if its a little bit?

I don't care what other communities do, we are not them, don't start comparing us to any community ""If they do it, why not we?"" because I personally don't want impurity in our community as a self, these crackers definitely cause harm to nature and animals (not to mention most of them are chinese made). I get raged when I see our other community members getting angry when someone sites the pollution or problem caused by this, its a fact, accept it and stop doing it!   
Why are we even bursting crackers? when none of our religious scriptures ask for it (ik crackers didn't exist back then), so if they celebrated Diwali without crackers, we must too! Its like our river situation, Ma Ganga being the most sacred is also the most polluted, for us the followers of Sanatana Dharma, whole nature is sacred, so better protect it and make pollution free rather than causing harm to it in any possible way.",31,True,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living,,0.48,False,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living

shark-shaped earrings are swinging to and fro, who is beautifully shining in the divine realm of Gokula, who  
\[due to the offense of breaking the pot of yogurt that His mother was churning into butter and then stealing  
the butter that was kept hanging from a swing\] is quickly running from the wooden grinding mortar in fear  
of mother Yasoda, but who has been caught from behind by her who ran after Him with greater speed—to  
that Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, I offer my humble obeisances.  
  
(2) Seeing the whipping stick in His mother’s hand,\] He is crying and rubbing His eyes again and again with  
His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with fear, and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is  
marked with three lines like a conchshell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to crying. To  
this Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, whose belly is bound not with ropes but with His mother’s pure love, I offer  
my humble obeisances.  
  
(3) By such childhood pastimes as this He is drowning the inhabitants of Gokula in pools of ecstasy, and  
is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in knowledge of His supreme majesty and opulence that He is  
only conquered by devotees whose pure love is imbued with intimacy and is free from all conceptions of awe  
and reverence. With great love I again offer my obeisances to Lord Damodara hundreds and hundreds of times.  
  
(4) 0 Lord, although You are able to give all kinds of benedictions, I do not pray to You for the boon of  
impersonal liberation, nor the highest liberation of eternal life in Vaikuntha, nor any other boon \[which may  
be obtained by executing the nine processes of bhakti\]. O Lord, I simply wish that this form of Yours as  
Bala Gopala in Vrindavana may ever be manifest in my heart, for what is the use to me of any other boon  
besides this?  
  
(5) 0 Lord, Your lotus face, which is encircled by locks of soft black hair tinged with red, is kissed again and  
again by mother Yasoda, and Your lips are reddish like the bimba fruit. May this beautiful vision of Your lotus  
face be ever manifest in my heart. Thousands and thousands of other benedictions are of no use to me.  
  
(6) 0 Supreme Godhead, I offer my obeisances unto You. O Damodara! O Ananta! O Vishnu! O master! O my  
Lord, be pleased upon me. By showering Your glance of mercy upon me, deliver this poor ignorant fool who  
is immersed in an ocean of worldly sorrows, and become visible to my eyes.  
  
(7) 0 Lord Damodara, just as the two sons of Kuvera—Manigriva and Nalakuvara—were delivered from the  
curse of Narada and made into great devotees by You in Your form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden  
grinding mortar, in the same way, please give to me Your own prema-bhakti. I only long for this and have  
no desire for any kind of liberation.  
  
(8) 0 Lord Damodara, I first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly effulgent rope which binds Your belly.  
I then offer my obeisances to Your belly, which is the abode of the entire universe. I humbly bow down to  
Your most beloved Srimati Radharani, and I offer all obeisances to You, the Supreme Lord, who displays

I continue it for a few days, in these days, my entire day remains well managed and disciplined. But I personally can't find any real devotion or meaning in doing naama japa. I meditate much better when I sit silently and observe my breath. I experience peace as well, this way. Plus I am much more inclined towards advaita and the idea of god being inside us and formless. So, imagining the deity and doing their naama japa doesn't sit right with me. It's very superficial to me and I know it deep inside.

I am not trying to disrespect any practise or deity, I am just trying to convey my situation.

But the thing is, even though it doesn't feel right doing these japaas, once I do them, I manage to get myself into a routine, for eg: just the idea that I have to do this many malas today, makes me disciplined and I can do my other tasks with ease. It improves my mental health, but since I don't feel much devotion or meaning, I stop the practise and then my discipline also breaks.

But Krishna is different. I feel a connection with him, I don't do any pooja or chant his mantras. But I feel, he was an enlightened person, just like us, and when I read more about him, I find myself aligning with his thought process more and more. I just want to say that I don't see him as an external god, but more like a realised person and I like how he doesn't force us to do any ritual or any practise. I can't explain, I just find myself aligning more with him spiritually and philosophically. I don't find any philosophical reasoning in mantra jaapa, that's why I see it as a chore.

I like meditating silently, but since, meditation doesn't have any concrete target like naama japa, where you can set a goal of doing x amount of malas, it is harder to do it daily. But I can't accept other things.

So as you can see I am quite confused and looking for some guidance. I don't find devotion while doing naama japa, I like meditating, but can't do it daily for more than a few days. If I don't do any spiritual practise daily, I give in to my procastinations and addictions (mainly social media and internet related) and my mental health worsens.",5,True,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living,,0.81,False,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living

The chakra and conch are Vishnu's symbols, however Surya and Vishnu are different (well, at least in modern Hinduism) and the symbolism of each item can be different.

So what deity i can worship or what stotras i should read to get  good lovers. Also any stotras to give me high wealth and luxurious life. I won't say i don't have money, i have enough wealth but only to live a mediocre life. And life do be getting boring because of that.

Day trading & karma : basically karma can reach you in two ways :

1) Someone makes a profit, sells the stock at a profitable price, you buy it and sell it at a profitable price. No bad karma on you.

2) Someone sells for a loss, you buy it, you sell for a profit.

So, isn't point 2 feasting on someone's loss? Won't I be gaining bad karma for this? My conscience is confused on it.

What will happen if I earn and live according to 2? I never know if the stock I have brought has been sold after a profit or a loss .

He mentioned that he read somewhere in the *Brahma Vaivarta Purana* that the *Peet Jati* (yellow race) would rule the world at the end of the Kali Yuga. To him, it seems like this prediction might be coming true, as Western competitiveness appears to be declining while China and other Asian countries are rising rapidly.

I’m curious about the authenticity of this claim. I trust my grandpa, but sometimes he can get details mixed up. There also seems to be some ambiguity regarding what *Peet Jati* refers to and who exactly it’s meant to describe.

Same if some Buddhist dies and gets reincarnated into a Hindu or Jain house. Now they might think that Buddhism is a wrong/misguided path.

Jains don't eat meat but Buddhists do—does it mean that whatever sacrifices they made in last birth are now meaningless?

To what degree calling them meaningless is justified?

Even if we say that somehow they might get some inspiration to change the faith they were born into and convert to some other faith, do we have a for-sure answer that the faith they choose to convert is the correct one?

What justification do we have, and what basis do we have to judge other faiths as right or wrong?

If the answer is nothing, then what is stopping us from following the customs, practices, and rituals of other faiths as well?

What is stopping a Jain from eating meat or a Buddhist from praying to Hindu gods?

And why limit it to Indian faiths only why not include religions like Druze or Pythagoreanism, and Platonism?

Why not behave like their followers do?

My name is Jaxx. I am a college student in the USA. I am majoring in psychology. Currently, I am taking an Intro to Psych class, which the class is based on a research project that me and my groupmates conducted. 

Our topic is the impact of religion on someone's overall happiness. The survey is completely anonymous; nobody will know what you answered. The questions include topics such as your personal religious affliation, how often you partake in activities, and how happy you feel. 

I'm posting here because I need a little more variety in my outreach for this survey. Throughout my postings, and hopefully whatever my groupmates are doing, we have not gathered many answers from Buddhist people. You can see in my account posts I have posted this to a few subreddits where it pertains, but unfortunately I just haven't had the outreach i need for certain demographics. 

Before you take this survey, I want to apologize for one of the questions. We are not in a relgion class, we are simply studying thr impacts of faith on happiness and life satisfaction. With this being said, nobody in my group knew that pagan and Wiccan are vastly different faiths. We went with what we see in media and other surveys, which was wrong. Unfortunately, once the survey is published, we cannot change this. I am sorry for the misrepresentation. Nonetheless, I hope you are still willing to take the survey. 

Thank you in advance, and I hope you allow this to be posted SO can gather my data 💜

I’m an Australian male (non-Nepali) who works with a group of Nepali men, who have become like brothers to me. With Diwali coming up, I wanted to show my appreciation by gifting them something. I asked if it would be okay, and two of them said yes, but the third one mentioned that only family can give gifts during Diwali.

I had already bought three gifts, which are small idols of Lord Ganesh, as one of my friends mentioned it would be a suitable choice. However, I’ve recently learned that gifting idols during Diwali might be considered inappropriate or frowned upon.

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do. Should I keep the gifts or look for alternatives? What would be more suitable to give during this time? I want to be respectful of their customs and traditions.

I apologise if this post breaks any rules, I will delete the post if necessary. This is also a throwaway account. I’m also sorry for the long post. 

So I (20F) am a part of a Hindu Brahmin family. Everyone in my family, especially my parents seem so connected to the Gods. I used to have that connection before, when I was around 16/17, but then it just disappeared. I have no idea why. And I don’t like it. 

I feel nothing when I enter the Pooja room at home. Like even when I light the lamp and do all the alankaras for the Gods, I feel nothing. It’s like doing a daily chore. In fact, I feel an aversion. Like even when I go to the temple I feel very … ""oh do I really have to go?"". I don’t like that I feel this way, it feels so wrong but I don’t know what to do. 

Even when I go to the temples, my mom tells me to look at the God’s eyes and say any Shloka. I do that, but I feel nothing. I feel no Bhakti. No connection. It feels wrong to be in the temple. 

My mom is a Shloka teacher and my dad goes for Veda lessons. So they’re quite religious and feel connected to the Gods, but there’s me, with no connection. 

I feel so guilty and sad and I don’t want to be this way. I want to go back to my old self. 

How do I feel more connected? How do I get Bhakti? I would appreciate some advice for this. 

Thank you very much.

I go to the Ganesha murti and think about how he snapped off his own tusk to keep his promise to Vyasa to keep writing the Mahabharata. I use it as an example of how I should keep my promises.



I see the Rama murti and remember he’s the exemplar of Dharma and how I need to be more like him to uphold Dharma in my own life.



The murti of Devi, the mother goddess makes me realize I need to appreciate my mother more and all she’s done for me.



Shiva’s murti encourages me to keep practicing Raja yoga for the benefit of both myself and others.

# Key Points to remember from Bhagavad Gita Chapter 8:

**The Nature of Reality and the Soul**

* **Brahman** is the ultimate reality, the supreme being that pervades everything.
* **Atman (Adhyatma):** The individual soul, a part of Brahman. Eternal, indestructible, divine. Appears separate, but ultimately identical to Brahman.
* **Karma** is the law of cause and effect that shapes our destiny.

**The Divine and the Material**

* **The Material Realm (Adhibhuta)** is the realm of the senses.
* **The Divine Realm (Adhidaiva)** is the universal form of the Lord, encompassing all demigods and representing the divine aspect of reality.
* **The Supreme Being (Adhiyajna)** is the ultimate source of creation and the controller of all beings (Lord of all sacrifices). 

**The Path to Liberation**

* **Remember God** at the time of death to attain liberation.
* **The Supreme Divine Personality** is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.
* **Om** is the sacred syllable associated with liberation.
* **The path to liberation** involves restraining the senses, focusing the mind on the heart, and drawing the life breath to the head.
* **The Supreme Abode** is the ultimate goal, beyond the cycle of birth and death.

**The Two Paths**

* **The path of light** leads to liberation.
* **The path of darkness** leads to rebirth.

**The Cosmic Cycle**

* **Brahma's day and night** each last for a thousand cycles of the four ages.
* **Creation and destruction:** All beings arise and perish within this cosmic cycle.
* **The eternal dimension:** Beyond this cycle is the eternal Supreme Abode.

**Key Points for Everyday Life**

* **The Power of Devotion:** Unwavering devotion to the Supreme Divine Personality is the key to attaining liberation.
* **Mind Control:** Restraining the senses and focusing the mind on the heart are crucial for spiritual progress.
* **Karma:** Selfless service and dedication to duty are essential for positive karma.
* **Cosmic Perspective:** Understanding the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction can provide a sense of perspective and detachment from worldly affairs.
* **The Supreme Abode:** The Supreme Abode is the ultimate goal beyond the cycle of birth and death.
* **The Two Paths:** Understanding the two paths of light and darkness is essential for making informed choices in life.
* **Understanding the Two Paths:** Those who understand the two paths of liberation and rebirth are never confused.
* **The Importance of Devotion:** Remaining steadfast in devotion to the Supreme Divine Personality is crucial for attaining the Supreme Abode.
* **The Superiority of Devotion:** Devotion surpasses the benefits of Vedic rituals, study of the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, and charities.

By incorporating these key points into daily life, individuals can strive towards spiritual enlightenment and a more fulfilling existence.

1g5dli4,Bestiality within Hinduism mythology and culture,i11sick,2024-10-17 00:49:30+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g5dli4/bestiality_within_hinduism_mythology_and_culture/,1,/r/hinduism/comments/1g5dli4/bestiality_within_hinduism_mythology_and_culture/,hinduism,"So there is this content creator on YouTube, a Poketuber, who made a video claiming Hinduism has beastiality in its mythology. 

The examples he gave were of Shiva and Agni regarding beastiality with a parrot. I corrected him saying that as parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech, thus, the bird in this context serves as a symbol of the spread of divine wisdom, rather than representing any form of inappropriate or sexual interactions. In certain retellings, the bird becomes a symbol of transmitting sacred knowledge and represents how divine wisdom can be passed through different mediums.

Another example he said was of King Pandu from the Hindu epic Mahabharata having relations with a deer. I corrected him saying that the deer in the story were actually a human couple, a sage (Reshi) named Kindama and his wife. They transformed using ""magic"" into deer to be intimate in the forest. Whether that transformation actually involved them physically turning into animals or was simply a magic cloak to impair so others perceived them as animals is up to interpretation, but regardless they were both animals, and I'm not sure if that counts as bestiality. Pandu killed the male deer in their intimacy and the sage reveals his true form before dying and curse Pandu, which was he will also die if he has sex.  

And then he shows an image of statues or sculptures outside temple walls depicting the act of bestiality. I say such depictions in temple art is not an endorsement of the practices. Instead, these images are often interpreted as part of a larger symbolic framework that addresses human desires, spiritual transcendence, and the holistic portrayal of life. Some interpretations suggest that the outer walls represent the world of maya (illusion) and worldly desires, which the devotee must leave behind when entering the temple's sacred space. Some scholars suggest that these carvings were meant to display the range of human behaviors—good, bad, and neutral—as a reflection of the human condition. This includes even taboo acts, not as an endorsement but to illustrate the breadth of human actions and the moral choices one must make.

His very last claim is the most bold and he states that many parts of Hinduism still allow bestiality on certain animals. That's a very bold claim and I'm quite unsure he should make such statement. So I ask the experts here, does such claim hold any factual truth? 

Note I do not believe his intentions were to slander Hinduism but to provide examples that such instances are common within the mythology of different cultures. ",2,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

1g511ol,"God helps on those who suffer, that's why true devotees are sad because God is giving them the ultimate happiness which others won't get. So if u are sad, thank God for it, and ask more and more sadness so that ur Bhakti in God becomes stronger and stronger.",av457av,2024-10-16 15:43:17+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g511ol/god_helps_on_those_who_suffer_thats_why_true/,4,/r/hinduism/comments/1g511ol/god_helps_on_those_who_suffer_thats_why_true/,hinduism,"Do you often feel like the more you worship, the more conflicts and suffering come to you. Do you see how the greatest devotees of God had to suffer so much sadness like Meera Bai and Prahlad.          
      
       
But God only gives sadness to devotees, so that they keep remembering God. See God is beyond good and evil. There is no wrong or right for Para Brahman. What you see as suffering is all viels of Maya, which you are allowing to fool you, just like how clouds cover the Sun.       
      
      
It is your fault, you were the one who did bad Karma, but God is beyond good and bad. God cannot differentiate between a righteous person who does good karma all the time, and between a evil person who does wrong all the time. God is ocean of mercy, and everyone is equal for God. People suffer because of their own mistakes and bad karma, ultimately it is some sort of Prarabdha, Sanchita, or Vartamaana bad Karma which is hindering you. You have lust, anger, envy, jealousy, greed, theft, and deceit in you, and no matter how much you keep doing good, you ultimately have selfish ends. Unless you give up your selfishness, God will never help you.       
      
       
All of this is caused by Ahankaara and Maya. You are verily Para Brahman, but you forgot it due to Ahankaara (ego) and Maya. And it is your fault, because you shouldn't have come in this world.       
      
        
So as soon as you meditate and give up ego, you will realise Paramatma. You will realise your true self. For that you must read and remember the 4 Vedas, and if you do not learn them by heart, then you are not a devotee and you cannot achieve Brahman.      
      
        
So whenever you feel why is your life so sad, then thank God for that. Bali bowed down to God, and he was burried down in Paatala Loka, then he became a donkey and suffered much sorrow. But you see, ultimately Bali was blessed to become the next Indra. So sorrows are nothing, they are Maya, and technically do not exist. Sadness is only trying to hide you from the real happiness, which God is waiting for you to get. So trust in God. And ask that your sadness never go away, ask so much sadness that you get desensitised towards it. God can also give you happiness, because if good and bad are same for God, then can God not give you happiness to come closer to God? But the problem there is, when God gives you happiness, you are the one who forget God and become indulged in worldy pleasures and wealth.          
          
           
So ask for sadness, poverty, affliction, conflicts and mental turmoil in your life, so that you can positively be immersed in Bhakti of God. Remember, God is hungry for you Bhaavas (feelings), this is why Shabari got Darshan of God and not the sages. Because the Sages who taught us the path of Gods, who showed us the correct way of a healthy, prosperous, pleasurable and spiritual life to connect with God, were driven by Ego Ahankara which covered them in Maya. This is why only true devotees who went through so much failures and sadness, only they were able to achieve God, because God sees only your feelings, everything else is just adambar (false show off). So be true to yourself, and always blame yourself, and purify yourself so that you reach God who is sitting above all the worlds, present everywhere within it, yet also away from it above all.",7,True,Other,,0.67,False,Other

I'm a recent convert who is interested in linguistics in general and a lot of hindus(from my experience) don't support the Aryan migration theory,let me repeat *Migration*(this may come of as rude as I've mentioned it already in my title but I've seen people confuse the 2 I'm trying to be as respectful as possible)

This is a genuine question, I've met so many hindus who believe in the out of india theory and even make absurd claims like tamil and other Dravidian languages being derived from Sanskrit which is not supported by any linguistic study.(even straight up refuted by them)

I've seen hindus who even deny the indo european links that sanskrit has,why are the denials of Aryan migration theory and proto indo european so widespread

 Sorry if anyone was offended or if this came out as rude but I'm honestly beginning to question my faith(again) rn because of these theories

1g4k0d7,Understanding the Nature of Detachment as Mentioned in Hindu Shastras,HeyBroWhatisUp,2024-10-15 23:16:02+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g4k0d7/understanding_the_nature_of_detachment_as/,4,/r/hinduism/comments/1g4k0d7/understanding_the_nature_of_detachment_as/,hinduism,"Through the words of sages and scriptures, it's been understood that the path to God and enlightenment comes through detachment of wordily things. Now attachments to elements like beauty, wealth, and status can be well understood under the prospectus of this philosophy. One does not need these things to find fulfillment.  Obsessions over these material things is immature and undermines the greater purpose of our lives. 

Now, what I struggle to understand is the human component of attachment, our attachment to others, to our loved ones. Through their love and compassion, we have felt the presence of the divine. If we were born in a dark empty cave with no one around, we would not know the definition of love. But it is due to these individuals in our life we were able to learn and experience unconditional love, and formulate an idea of what God is like. Now does detachment mean to sever our relationships with them, put an end to this bond in which Krishna himself resides? 

Now, the answers I've heard have been nuanced, but most say that you do not forfeit your love, just your attachment. Without attachment, love them and perform your duties, as a child, husband, father, whatever it may be. But without attachment, can that love still be special, or does it dilute to becoming a generic love that we have for all people? Dharma is simply about doing what needs to be done while in the role we are playing. If I am married, it is my dharma to carry out my responsibilities as a husband, regardless of who my wife is. If I was detached, I will love her as she is part of the divine just like everyone else and that she is my wife. But if I was attached, I will love her for who she is, and no one can take her spot. She is my soulmate, and her and her alone in my life, can bring me joy. Her love for me and my love for her is special and holy. Its more than just the love I have for everyone else. It's special, pure, and unique to our bond. 

Now I know this is attachment, and according to common thought, this distracts you from God. But this is a complex element of life that not even Lord Rama could escape. When we needed to relinquish the throne, he did so without second thought. Material things did not matter to him. But when Laxman was injured by Indrajit, even Lord Rama came to tears.

It might be possible to let go of attachment, live life as a sanyasi or in sansara devoid of heartfelt relationships. When there is nothing to lose, one does not feel sorrow nor grief. But while in this form one tries to come closer to the divine, it still feels lacking. There feels to be something godly in those attachments we had, something pure and heartfelt. And when we suffer loss, its extraordinarily painful, but there is something sweet where we wouldn't have it any other way. Its similar to truth. Truth can hurt and cause pain, but its far better than living without it. Similarly, attachment to others might bring suffering, buts it feels better than living without it. 

Now, I know you might be thinking that my feelings contradict scripture, that I still have not found God, or have not understood the true nature of God. Nevertheless, I have felt his presence in the timeless bonds I have with others. In the joys of life, he's been present, but in the sorrows too, he has been present.

But in the case of God, the name is non-different from the object. So, Hari the name is non-different from the person Hari. Hari is Hari. The name and the object are one.

I want to get converted into Hinduism. 
I love their ethics their devotion their peace loving & all. 
I've been going to their temples & their Durga Pujo since 2009.
I've been practicing their religion by myself such as having a status of God ""Radha-Krisna"" in my room & a pamphlet of goddess of knowledge ""Swaraswati"" in my university dorm room, going to temple when I get the time ,fating & all..
I've graduated from a prestigious university & currently undergoing post graduate studies & soon I'll be hunting for a job.
Before joining any jobs & starting my life I'd like to convert into Hinduism.
I mean really convert. 
Like changing my name into an actual Hindu name & do the retual called ""Satya-joggo""/""Suddhi-joggo"".
I've already been talking with one of the Hindu lawyer & he's trying his best to do so but as we all know Bangladesh is not a safe place for Hindus & our political & religious instability is beyond hope. So I'm finding it very difficult. & The question of conversion is like a taboo here. There are many extremist groups who would even threaten me to death if I come out publicly saying I want to convert into Hinduism.
Ik the risks & all but still I want to do it.
I gave up my soul & denotation to the True religion of Sanatana.To Durga maa To RadhaKrishna.Soon I've been practicing in the dark alone.i want to live & die as a true hindu.i want to have an identity as one too. I want to partake in all the puja & rituals as one.so that even if anybody ask me about my document or id I could show them & say as a proud devotee ""I'm a Hindu I may not be born into this but I found it & I'm going to follow it till the day I spend my last bit of breath"" 
Because when I visit the temples & the pujas like Durga puja I feel so scared & insecure what if they find out I'm not a Hindu by birth & what if the think of me as an agent of extremist party trying to infiltrate their holy retual & destroying peace...(too many horrid incidents have occurred here in my country ,too many extremist party.it's a shame how minority is treated even in an independent country)

Ik all the risks & all the criticism that might come in my coming years..but I still am determined to do so.i want to die as an Hindu.get proper funeral the cleansing of fire.& Everything.

Before that
I've a few questions like if I get converted in Hinduism which group I'll be. Ik that there are 4 groups(Varna) in Hinduism (Brahmins,Kshatriyas,Vaishyas,Shudras)...also will I be eligible for a proper funeral. & Will the gods accept me as a servant of them both in my lifetime & after death. & If I ever want to get married will I be able to marry a devotee of Hinduism or will I have to marry someone who is also a convert like me? I don't care about the extremist society I'd live amongest the Hindu neighborhood & raise my family & children as one too. But will they accept me ? 
Ik my future kids might get into many problems in schools & other institutions throughout their lives for me & my name. I don't want them to suffer that's why I've already tried my lawyer to change my National ID cards name & all of my academic certificates name but it's a lengthy process & too much drawing attention to self. It could destroy my family (my mother & 2 sisters ) reputation & all moreover threats from the extremist society ... 

That's why I've planned to post it here...I don't to change my religion & do the necessary retuals before getting into any jobs ... I want to do it under my new name (if possible).if not I'd like to keep my birth name in my certificates & NID but have the necessary documents to live as a peace loving Hindu & follow all the rituals & do all the fasting in akadoshis & all ... 

Plz give some suggestions... Also if anyone's from Bangladesh plz help me if you could...

I don't have the age to be asked for adoption by any Hindu family who doesn't have any kids or such .. I don't even have the financial ability to move into another country such as India or abroad so I could freely follow My desired religion... I was born into Bangladesh & born in a family which was not Hindu.. it's not my fault... But dying as one who is not Hindu seems a waste of my life... & I can't take it ... 
So I with my sound mind & clear consciousness I want to convert ...

So I'm looking towards hinduism and trying to see if there are any good arguments for the existence of multiples deities and Brahman. I already believe, more or less, in reincarnation and karma.

I had read the Bhagavad Gita once, and it didn't convince me. I also looked at how to teach hinduism to your child, which wasn't useful for me. On the other hand, I'm trying to read stuff by Ramanuja or Udayana which is too advanced or dense for me to make it through. Any good arguments or books to learn from?

The entire ritual is based on  the story of Rishi sunashepa who was saved from a human sacrifice by the intervention of varuna.  Not even the pali canon has statements denouncing vedas for human sacrifices, they only talked about animal sacrifices.

> 12. By means of the Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa (litany), the Brahman priest (seated) to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the stakes) with this sixteen-versed (hymn, Ṛg-v. X, 90, Vāj. S. XXXI, 1-16), 'The thousand-headed Puruṣa, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed[7] . . .;'--thus (he does) for the obtainment and the securing of everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Puruṣamedha is everything: in thus saying, 'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and thereby indeed magnifies him (Puruṣa); but he also thereby speaks of him, such as he is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they were not yet slaughtered,--
13. Then a voice[8] said to him, **'Puruṣa, do not consummate (these human victims[9]): if thou wert to consummate them, man (puruṣa) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried round them, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same divinities[10], and thereby gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him with all objects of desire.**
14. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with fiery mettle he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.


If tantra had human sacrifices it was against vedic sanction and should be seen as a transgressive heteropraxy.

https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-english/d/doc63525.html



**What exactly is the purushamedha**

The purushamedha ritual is the ritual through which the sacrificer gives up all worldly possessions and becomes a renunciate/forest hermit. This ritual is where the purusha sukta is used.


> And if a Brāhmaṇa performs the sacrifice, he should bestow all his property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brāhmaṇa is everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Puruṣamedha is everything.

> 20. And having taken up the two fires within his own self[13], and worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa (litany, viz. Vāj. S. XXXI, 17-22), let him betake himself to the forest without looking round; and that (place), indeed, is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village, let him take up again the two fires

This stems from the unspoken vedic idea of ritualizing/seeing reversible(cyclic?) yajnas appearing in the world processes(yajna also stands for all processes that maintain the world - please refer gita's  karma chapters to know more). The causal sequence of world manifestation in the purusha sukta is Purusha Narayana -> Viraj -> (Purusha) Everything.

So by giving up everything that he possesses(and external forms of rituals)  he can obtain the purusha(which is everything) or atleast begin his journey through jnana marga.

Hence purushamedha can be read as sacrificing(medha) your worldly self(purusha) and also as bringing to one's intellect(medha) the inner self(purusha narayana).  So much for a ritual wrongly portrayed as a human sacrifice to obtain worldy benefits.

This end goal also sheds some theological light into the  sunashepa katha from which the ritual seems to have been inspired. Sunashepa was freed by Varuna from his bonds chaining him to the sacrificial altar/ritual(possibly a symbol for the worldy life) when he created rks literally becoming a rishi aka *seer of Brahman*.",12,True,Refutation,,0.95,False,Refutation

My grandfather would sit there reading the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the other epics to me.

I’ve been following Sadhguru’s Isha Yoga path for 6 years, which I believe aligns with the Ashtanga Patanjali Sutras. I dedicate 2-3 hours daily to asanas and pranayama, and for the last 2 years, I’ve been practicing Samyama. After completing my Navratri Sadhana this October, I’ve felt a deep calling toward Devi Sadhana or Shakti Sadhana, alongside my existing Shiva-focused practices.

During the recent Navratri, I performed 3 days of Kali, 3 days of Lakshmi, and 3 days of Saraswati, I sense a specific calling towards individual Devis, and I’m trying to understand how to honor that.

I know there are four Navratris in the year, but I’m only familiar with the one that just happened in October. I’m wondering:

* Which Devi (Kali, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, etc.) to invoke on specific moon days?
* What mantras (without beej mantras) can be used for these sadhanas?
* Should I continue focusing on Linga Bhairavi Sadhana, or explore individual Devi Sadhanas as well?

One guy on his forum said, ""Enlightened people don't need this concept called Kṛṣṇa."" Many enlightened sages worshipped Kṛṣṇa. Sage Parāṣara called Lord Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān. Kṛṣṇa is not just a concept people believe in. He is reality.

Thought that since the temple is so close on Mondays I will go there and do my jaap as well as offer water and milk to the shivling. However I have visited the temple 3 times now and each time there had been some issue -
1. First time I went late in the evening and while I was praying a rat walked very close to my feet and I was startled since my eyes were closed 
2. Second time I went early in the morning I saw some big ants but still continued my prayers when I was done they had bitten me all over my leg and it was quite painful that day
3. And when I visited the temple early morning today I was feeling unnecessaryily hot like it wasn't that hot while I was walking there but in the temple I felt very breathless. 

I know the first 2 especially could just be coincidence but from today I can't help but feel like there is either some weird energy in the temple or shiv ji is angry with me. Though at home I have never had any issues always feel at peace whenever I complete my jaap.

By tradition of course we have a Kuladevi. We worship her during Navratri and sometimes during other ocassions. I have always been curious abt Shakta traditions. I come from Maharashtra where there are strong pockets of Devi devotion. I am somehow more aware of Vaishnava and Shaiva culture, texts and traditions than Shakta. 

Few questions 

1) Primary texts related to Shakta?
2) Does Shakta have to involve learning Tantra (I know even daily puja is Tantra but what I mean is Advanced Tantra)
3) Like Iskcon is for Vaishnavas or Isha or Lingayats are for Shaiva (I also know many ppl dont like them here on this forum), why is there no major organisation for promoting Shakta/Devi worship globally? 
4) Can one achieve moksha by Devi Bhakti alone? 
5) Just like Aum Namah Shivay or Aum Namo Narayana, what is the basic key mantra for Shakta tradtions?

1.Nearly all scriptures, their commentaries from various sages/schools of thoughts ,explanations and many other references are freely available

2.Lots of perspectives,schools of thoughts and philosophy can be easily explored, summarized and evaluated effieciently.

3.In-depth and step by step meditation and other techniques from various cultures,traditions and personal discoveries

**Now these are the breathtaking ones that are recently possible in easiest way:**

1.Ability to create one's own school of thoughts:

Utilizing AI in order to input our fundamental thoughts, and creation of its application,expansion as well as revision on every aspect of life using various scriptures from upanishads,puranas or other texts as base. Just like many texts originated taking aspects of vedas as base, we can create many aspects using scriptures as base. For example, i explored about river and philosophy and meditation of river to explain each part of life and universe.Creation of sanskrit mantras, knowledge about aspect of reality and practical worship/meditation can be generated using references from thousands of other sages's knowledge

2.Ability to create images and videos of ishvara for bhakti:

To be able to input any quality,attribute and create a diety residing on cosmos or river or hill or any way one wishes is revolutionizing as it assists in personalizing the meditation and visualization. If you wish to worship krishna as friend, a father or even a teacher, you can make it . If you want to worship durga mata as a child , you can create image and worship. If you want to create an image of shiva on cosmic background , dancing with destruction, you can create it as well and worship that form. 

3.Ability to create own songs:

Currently, we can even create songs to invoke awareness or devotion , that is beautiful and can exactly replicate one's current stage . I tried creating isha upanishad song  and another sanskrit song, and i can feel bliss and progress in bhakti more deeply than if i simply contemplated lines, since bhajans and kirtan can be created for one's favourite diety and scriputure. Any way , many many methods and paths are now available.

Its so interesting to compare the base opinion I grew up with of ""she was evil"" with the much more nuanced view of her I developed after reading valmiki ramayan. There's just the perfect amount of information to base a novel off of on: warrior princess, grew up amongst brothers, a tinge of mythicism with her left hand being as hard as diamond, who's mother was thrown out by her own father, who thus developed a close bond with her nurse maid manthara, (which may justify how she was poisoned by her considering shes the only mother she has known), who eventually, perhaps stemming from the fear of seeing her own queen being thrown out by kaikeyis father, warned kaikeyi, that from her perspective, kaikeyi would be treated the same. The innocence of not knowing the exact rules of succession, the fear of being thrown out overtaking her love for ram, her head strong attitude, everything paints a tragic and beautiful story that can be written with her inner voice. Coupled with my love for ramayan the legend of Prince Ram, i wanted to write a book on her. Then i discovered that was already done by Vaishnavi Patel, being exactly what I had in mind. I was a bit heartbroken I must admit, but I mean, good for her, its a brilliant book. The question remains, my fellow gen z Hindus, or lovers of retellings of mythology, just  what's that one character you want explored, who you want to see an itihasa from the perspective of- or can I still write something on kaikeyi...

First of all, I'd like to make it clear that I've not read any scriptures or texts. My question is, after seeing so many cartoons, series, and films on the life of Lord Krishn, I've noticed that in many adaptations, Nand helped Vasudev by keeping Krishn and exchanging his daughter Yogmaya with him. Other adaptations show that Vasudev secretly placed Krishn in the crib of Nand and Yashoda's daughter and took their daughter with him.

I'd like to clear up my doubts about what actually occurred. Did Nand already know about Krishn's truth? If so, why would he agree to exchange his child for Vasudev's? That's weird to me. And that he hid the truth from Yashoda all the while.",10,True,Question - General,,0.92,False,Question - General

It usually lasts for 15 days and celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the  demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.

Dashain celebrations involve several specific rituals that hold great significance. Here are some of the key rituals:

1. Ghatasthapana: This marks the beginning of Dashain. A sacred pot (ghata) is placed in a designated area, usually in a temple or home, and filled with holy water. Barley seeds are sown around it to grow jamara, which symbolizes prosperity.

2. Worship of Durga: For the first nine days, devotees worship the goddess Durga through various rituals and offerings, including prayers, flowers, and food.

3. Nawami : On the ninth day, Some people offers Animal, as a way to appease the goddess. With Changing time, most of the people especially in city area started offering Ash Guord (Kubhindo) in place of animals.

4. Dashami Tika: On the tenth day, which is the main day of Dashain, elders give tika ( mixture of rice,yogurt & cinnaba) and jamara to younger family members, blessing them for health, prosperity, and success. They prepare special dishes & sweets & Visits important relatives house to put tika.This is a time for family gatherings and celebrations.

These rituals not only honor the goddess but also strengthen family bonds and cultural traditions during the festival. ",2,False,Hindū Rituals & Saṃskāras (Rites),,0.99,False,Hindū Rituals & Saṃskāras (Rites)

Continued from the previous part..................

***13. “The great souls who have attained Me, never take rebirth in this temporary and suffering world, as they have achieved the highest perfection.”***

***- Verse 8.15***

***14. “Arjuna, you will be reborn in all the worlds up to the abode of Brahma, but on reaching My abode there is no rebirth.”***

***- Verse 8.16***

***15. “A day of Brahma is as long as a thousand cycles of the four ages. His night is also the same length. Those who understand this understand the true nature of day and night.”***

***- Verse 8.17***

***16. “At the beginning of each Brahma's day, countless beings are born. At the end of Brahma's night, they are destroyed, only to be reborn at the beginning of the next day.”***

***- Verse 8.19***

***17. “Beyond this manifested and unmanifested world, there exists an eternal unmanifest realm which is not destroyed even when everything else is destroyed.”***

***- Verse 8.20***

***18. “The eternal, unmanifest realm is the ultimate destination. Once reached, there is no return to this world. This is My supreme abode.”***

***- Verse 8.21***

***19. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the greatest of all, can only be known through unwavering devotion. He is all-pervading in nature and all beings are situated within Him.”***

***- Verse 8.22***

***20. “I will now explain the different times (paths) at which a yogi never returns and also returns during that time of departing (from this world), O Best of Bharatas.”***

***- Verse 8.23***

***21. “By following the path of fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of sun's northern journey, those who know the Brahman, attains Brahman.”***

***- Verse 8.24***

The verse describes the auspicious conditions for attaining Brahman, the Supreme Divine:

* **""By following the path of fire"":** This refers to performing Vedic rituals and sacrifices, which are often associated with fire.
* **""light"":** This refers to the bright part of the day, as opposed to the dark part of the night.
* **""daytime"":** This indicates that the departure should occur during the day, not at night.
* **""the bright fortnight"":** This refers to the waxing phase of the moon, which is considered auspicious.
* **""the six months of the sun's northern course"":** This refers to the period when the sun is traveling northward in the sky, which is considered auspicious for spiritual practices.
* **""those who know the Brahman"":** This refers to individuals who have a deep understanding and realization of the Supreme Being.

If a person who knows Brahman departs from this world **during these auspicious times**, **they attain Brahman, the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation.**

***22. “The yogi who departs from this world during the smoke (twilight period), night-time, the dark fortnight, and the six months when the sun travels southward attain the moon, the lunar light but will eventually return to Earth.”***

***- Verse 8.25***

The verse describes the fate of individuals who practice Vedic rituals and depart from this world during inauspicious times:

**The smoke:** This refers to the twilight period, which is considered inauspicious.

**Night-time:** Nighttime is generally considered less auspicious than daytime for spiritual pursuits.

**The dark fortnight of the moon:** The waning phase of the moon is believed to be less conducive to spiritual progress.

**The six months when the sun travels southward:** This refers to the southern course of the sun, which is considered less auspicious than the northern course.

**Attaining the moon:** Those who depart during these inauspicious times are said to attain the moon, which is considered a celestial abode or heavenly realm.

**Returning to Earth:** Despite attaining the celestial abodes, they will eventually return to Earth. This suggests that the happiness and rewards obtained in the celestial realms are temporary and do not lead to eternal liberation.

Overall, the above two verses emphasize that the timing of one's departure from this world can significantly influence their afterlife. Those who depart during auspicious times are more likely to attain liberation, while those who depart during inauspicious times may experience temporary happiness in the celestial abodes but will ultimately return to Earth.

***23. “The path of light and the path of darkness are eternal for the world. By the one (the path of light), one does not return (rebirth), by the other (the path of darkness), one returns again.”***

***- Verse 8.26***

**The two paths:** The above are the two paths for departing from this world.

**The path of light:** This path leads to **liberation** and does not result in rebirth.

**The path of darkness:** This path leads to **rebirth**, and those who follow it will eventually return to the material world.

***24. “Those yogis who understand these two paths are never confused. Therefore, always remain in Yog, O Arjuna.”***

***- Verse 8.27***

**Understanding of the two paths:** Those who understand the paths of light and darkness are not confused. This implies that having knowledge of the different paths leading to liberation and rebirth is essential for avoiding spiritual confusion.

**Remaining in Yog:** The advice to ""always remain in Yog"" underscores the significance of maintaining a state of **union with God**. Yogic practices, such as *meditation, breath control, ethical conduct and the overall firm devotion*, are essential for achieving and maintaining this state. 

Overall, the verse suggests that by understanding the two paths and practicing Yog, one can avoid spiritual confusion and attain liberation.

***25. “The fruit of the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities is mentioned. The yogi who knows this fact (the fact of the above two paths) gains beyond all these (the mentioned fruit) and attains the Supreme Abode.”***

***- Verse 8.28***

The verse highlights the contrast between the conventional spiritual practices and the path of devotion.

**Conventional Spiritual Practices:**

* **Study of the Vedas:** The Vedas are ancient Hindu scriptures that contain a vast body of knowledge about spiritual matters.
* **Performance of sacrifices:** Sacrifices are religious ceremonies involving the offering of various items to deities.
* **Austerities:** Austerities are self-imposed disciplines or hardships undertaken for spiritual purification.
* **Charities:** Giving to charity is considered a virtuous act.

**The Yogi's Path:**

* **Understanding the two paths:** The yogi who understands the true nature of the spiritual path recognizes that there are two paths to departure: **the path of light and the path of darkness.**
* **Gaining beyond all these:** The yogi who follows the path of light, which involves devotion to the Supreme Being, achieves a higher level of spiritual attainment than those who merely engage in the conventional spiritual practices.
* **Attaining the Supreme Abode:** The ultimate goal of the yogi is to attain the Supreme Abode, which is the ultimate state of liberation.

In essence, the verse emphasizes that while conventional spiritual practices can yield certain benefits, the path of devotion to the Supreme Being is superior and leads to the ultimate goal of liberation.

When the cosmos was a void of darkness, a divine light manifested and took the form of Goddess Mahashakti. She then created the Trinity of Gods—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and guided them to meditate to understand their roles as creator, preserver, and destroyer. Pleased with their devotion, Mahashakti appeared as Siddhidhatri, bestowing upon the gods their consorts Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati respectively, to give them the power, the shakti, to carry out their duties.

In her iconography, Siddhidhatri is depicted seated on a lotus with four arms, holding a chakra (disc), shankha (conch), mace, and lotus. Her presence symbolizes the dispelling of ignorance and the bestowal of knowledge to realize the ultimate reality, Brahman.

Here's how each form can correspond to a woman's lifecycle: 

**NORTH INDIA-** 

1. **Shailaputri (Daughter of the Mountains)** – **Birth and Childhood**
   * Shailaputri represents the pure, innocent, and powerful spirit of a young girl. Just as she is the daughter of the Himalayas, a girl at this stage is seen as the embodiment of purity, potential, and the untainted beginning of life.
2. **\*\*Brahmacharini (The Ascetic)\*\* – \*\*Adolescence and Learning\*\***
   * This form signifies devotion, penance, and the pursuit of knowledge. During adolescence, a girl is often focused on learning, both academically and spiritually, discovering herself and the world. Brahmacharini symbolizes discipline, strength, and a commitment to growth.
3. **Chandraghanta (Warrior with a Crescent Moon) – Young Adulthood**
   * In this form, the goddess is a warrior, strong and ready to fight for justice. This stage represents a woman stepping into her own power, establishing her identity, and taking on the challenges of life with courage and determination.
4. **Kushmanda (The Creator of the Universe) – Creation and Nurturing**
   * Kushmanda is often associated with the creative energy that gives birth to life. This form reflects the nurturing aspect of a woman, often linked with motherhood or the creation of something new, whether it's giving birth to a child or fostering a creative project or career.
5. **Skandamata (Mother of Skanda) – Motherhood and Protection**
   * Skandamata, the mother of Skanda (Kartikeya), represents the protective and caring nature of a mother. This stage symbolizes a woman’s role as a nurturer and protector of her family, especially her children, emphasizing the fierce love and protection that a mother provides.
6. **Katyayani (The Warrior Goddess) – Strength and Leadership**
   * Katyayani represents a fierce warrior who embodies strength and courage. At this stage, a woman often takes on leadership roles, whether in her family, career, or community. She becomes a protector, guiding and supporting others while asserting her own power and independence.
7. **Kaalratri (The Fearsome Night) – Challenges and Transformation**
   * Kaalratri is the form of Durga that is dark, fierce, and protective, symbolizing the challenging phases of life. This stage in a woman's life reflects the trials, fears, and adversities she faces, but also her capacity to overcome them. It is a time of deep transformation and resilience.
8. **Mahagauri (The Radiant One) – Wisdom and Maturity**
   * Mahagauri represents purity, wisdom, and calm after overcoming challenges. As a woman grows older, she embodies a serene wisdom and inner radiance that comes from life experience, knowledge, and a deeper understanding of herself and the world around her.
9. **Siddhidhatri (The Granter of Boons) – Fulfillment and Legacy**
   * Siddhidhatri, the giver of boons, represents a woman in her later years who has achieved a sense of fulfillment and wisdom. This stage reflects a woman's role in passing on her knowledge, nurturing the next generation, and leaving behind a legacy of strength, love, and wisdom.

  
**SOUTH INDIA**

# 1. Durga (First Three Days) – Power and Protection

* **Durga** represents the **destructive** and **protective** aspects of the Goddess, who eliminates evil forces and restores righteousness. In South Indian traditions, these first three days are dedicated to **Kali, Bhadrakali, and Chamundeshwari**, among other fierce forms.
* **Kali** is the fierce protector and warrior who destroys evil forces like demons, symbolizing a woman's ability to face challenges fearlessly.
* **Bhadrakali** is a benevolent, protective form, symbolizing the destruction of ignorance.
* **Chamundeshwari** is the slayer of demons like Chanda and Munda, emphasizing the defeat of arrogance and negativity.

These forms are venerated for their ability to remove obstacles, protect from harm, and destroy negative forces in one's life.

# 2. Lakshmi (Second Three Days) – Wealth and Prosperity

* The next three days of Navaratri focus on **Goddess Lakshmi**, the embodiment of wealth, abundance, and well-being. In South India, these days emphasize the role of the Goddess in bringing **material and spiritual prosperity**.
* **Mahalakshmi** represents wealth, fortune, and fertility.
* **Gaja Lakshmi** is worshipped as the giver of prosperity, often shown with elephants as symbols of power and abundance.
* **Dhanalakshmi** bestows wealth and prosperity, both material and spiritual.

These days also symbolize the importance of hard work, growth, and the nurturing aspect of women, where they are seen as the source of prosperity and nurturing energy in the household and community.

# 3. Saraswati (Final Three Days) – Wisdom and Knowledge

* The final three days are dedicated to **Saraswati**, the Goddess of wisdom, learning, and the arts. In South India, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, **Saraswati Puja** is a major highlight, symbolizing the importance of acquiring knowledge and refining one’s skills.
* **Saraswati** is depicted as seated on a lotus or swan, holding a **veena**, representing music, knowledge, and wisdom.
* **Sharada** is another form of Saraswati, worshipped particularly in Karnataka, representing the purity of knowledge and learning.",1,True,History/Lecture/Knowledge,,0.79,False,History/Lecture/Knowledge

So here goes. 

I would like to create a community where we mostly learn about various theologies including our own and learn to respond to arguments by Christians, Muslims, and even Buddhists (less so but there are aggressive ones). Mainly because a lot of these people come very well trained and read in their scriptures as well as some of ours and many Hindus irl don't have deep answers to them. They say we follow it because it is cool etc but don't really understand the depth in their own traditions as well as the shortcomings in other ones (and maybe their own ideas) from a logical and argumentation standpoint. Now, I know we have a long tradition of discussion but most of those rely on the opponent having some sort of respect or familiarity with the Vedas as an authority. What I want to see is can we develop arguments for pantheism or panentheism or Dvaita from Western logic. Not to humiliate others, but to lay out our positions. So that people disconnected from such ideas understand, with lesser reliance on emotional/spiritual truths, even though they do bring many converts and are transformative.

Let me know if I'm stepping out of line or whether you would be interested in a Discord server or other medium for this. I would need mod help.

I have done much study myself but I'm a bit lonely so this seems great way to make friends but also contribute. I've never done anything like this before so I hope some people engage with this.",4,True,Question - General,,0.67,False,Question - General

A lot of Punjabi Hindus follow Sikhism and go to Gurudwaras (some times more than Temples) and many have more devotion towards Sikhism than Hindu deities like Ram/Shiv. This is not a Khatri-Arora thing and there is nothing wrong in this. I've seen some Hindus marrying with Sikh traditions. Is it any sect thing or varies from family to family? My family only follow one religion and it was surprising to know that many Hindus follow both the religions together.

Srinivasacharya regards Brahman as the universal soul, both transcendent and immanent, referred to by various names such as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Viṣnu, Vāsudeva, Purushottama, Nārāyaņa, Paramatman, Bhagawan and so on. Similarly, Nimbārkācārya, in his Vedanta Kamadhenu Daśaślokī, refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa alongside his consort Śrī Rādhā.﻿ 

Brahman is the supreme being, the source of all auspicious qualities, and possesses unfathomable attributes. ﻿He is omnipresent, omniscient, the lord of all, and greater than all. None can be equal to or superior to Brahman. 'ब्रह्म चाचिन्त्यानन्तनिरतिशयस्वाभाविकवृद्धत्तमस्वरूपगुणाद्याश्रयभूतः सर्वज्ञः सर्वशक्तिः सर्वेश्वरः सर्वकारणरूपः समानातिशयशून्यः सर्वव्यापकः सर्ववेदकैवेद्यः श्रीकृष्णएव बृहति बृंहयति तस्मादुच्यते परं ब्रह्म ।'

Brahman is possessed of two-fold characteristics; the śruti passages that refer to nirguṇa Brahman signify Brahman not having the faults of material modes of nature, while the śruti passages that refer to saguṇa Brahman signify Brahman having natural unfathomable auspicious qualities.
'निर्गुणवाक्यानां मायिकगुणनिषेषपरत्वेन सगुणवचनानां स्वाभाविकगुणप्रतिपादनपरत्वेन'

Brahman is the creator, cause of creation, maintenance and destruction of the world.
""सर्वशक्तिः सार्वज्यादिगुणवान् सर्वेश्वरः पुरुषोत्तम एव जगद्धेतुरिति निश्चेतुं शक्यते।""

It is Brahman from whom, the universe originates, on whom it subsists and in whom it finally merges. Here ‘origination’ means the expansion of the manifold consciousness of the sentient being, due to its connection with a body and the rest; and ‘dissolution’ means its entrance into the Cause (Brahman), resulting from the contraction of its consciousness. 'उक्तः अत्रचेतनस्यानादिनिधनस्य देहाविसंयोगहेतुकविचित्रविज्ञानविकाशो जन्म तत्संकोचपूर्वकः कारणप्रवेशः प्रलयः'

Brahman is both material and efficient cause of the world. 'तथाच जगदभिन्ननिमित्तोपादानत्वे सति सत्यत्वादिमत्त्वं ब्रह्मलत्तणंसिद्धम्।'

MATERIAL CAUSE(UPĀDĀNA)

Brahman is the material cause of the world in the sense of turning his natural powers known as Parā Śakti and Aparā Śakti, from the subtle form into the gross form which gave rise to various further effects, existent and inherent in them respectively. 'परापरादिशब्दाभिधेयानां स्वस्वाभाविकीनां सूक्ष्मावस्थापन्नानां शक्तीनां. तत्तद्‌गतसरूपकार्याणाञ्च स्थूलतयाप्रकाशकत्वमुपादानत्वम् ।'

Although these as a power, different from the possessor of powers, yet it is non-different from Brahman, because of having no existence and activity apart from the possessor.
'शक्तित्वेन शक्तिमतोभिन्ना।' शक्तिमत्पृथकूस्थितिप्रवृत्त्यभावाद्ब्रह्माऽभिन्ना ।' 

EFFICIENT CAUSE (NIMITTA)
Brahman functions as the efficient cause by facilitating the union of sentient beings, whose inherent knowledge remains in a state of profound contraction due to the enduring influence of their beginningless karmic impressions. This contracted state renders them incapable of recollecting the experiences they are destined to undergo in their current life. Through the manifestation of knowledge, Brahman enables them to become aware of and experience the results of their past karmas, along with the appropriate instruments for their fruition. स्वस्वानादिकर्मसंस्कारवशीभूतात्यन्तसङ्कुचितभोगस्मरणानईज्ञानधर्माणां चेतनानां कर्मफलभोगाईज्ञानप्रकाशनेन तत्तत्कम्र्मफलतत्तद्भोगसाधनैः सह
योजयितृत्वं निमित्तत्वम् ।

The explanation regarding the efficient cause is further simplified by Sri Purushottamacharya in Vedanta Ratna Manjusha. He explains that the Lord serves as the efficient cause by governing the destinies of individual souls with strict justice. During the cosmic dissolution, the impressions of past karmas become obscured and confused. However, at the time of creation, the Lord reawakens these impressions in each soul, ensuring that every individual undergoes the consequences of their previous actions.
'निमितत्वञ्च–स्वस्वानादिकम्र्मसंस्कारवशीभूतात्यन्तसंकुचितस्मृत्यनर्हज्ञानानां चेतनानां कर्मफलभोगाईज्ञानप्रकाशेन तत्तत्कर्मफलतत्तद्भोगसाधनैः सह संयोजयितृत्वम् ।'

CREATION

In the scriptures, Brahman is referred to as Āptakāma, meaning ""one whose desires are fully realized."" This raises the question: what purpose does Brahman, who lacks unfulfilled desires, have in creating the universe?

To address this, the Srinivasacharya refers to the concept of lila (divine play), as expounded by Bādarāyaṇa in the Brahma Sūtras, particularly the aphorism ""लोकवत्तु लीलाकैवल्यम् ॥"", which translates to ""creation is merely a sport for Brahman."" Here, the term lila denotes an activity performed spontaneously and joyfully, much like a playful act that requires no effort or intent. As described, lila is characterized as an effortless, joyful expression, unlike a deliberate, self-conscious exertion. In line with this idea, Srinivasacharya holds that the creation of the universe is a lila of Brahman—a natural and unmotivated expression of divine bliss.

This analogy is further illustrated by comparing Brahman to a sovereign king, who, despite having all his desires fulfilled, occasionally engages in playful activities purely out of exuberance and joy. Just as a person overflowing with happiness may dance or sing without any specific purpose, so too does Brahman create the universe as a spontaneous expression of bliss, without any underlying motive or goal.
'यथा खलु लोके प्राप्तैश्वर्यस्य सार्वभौमस्य फलसङ्कल्पं विनैव विचित्रमक्षकन्दुकादिभिर्विक्रीडनं लीलामात्रं दृश्यते, तथा ब्रह्मणोऽपि लीलाकैवल्यं, केवळं विश्वोत्पादनादिक्रीडामात्रमित्यर्थः ॥'

However, this leads to another question: if creation is a lila, does that imply it is devoid of any significance or guiding principle? In response, it is clarified that while creation is a lila, it is still governed by a sense of order and justice. Brahman creates the universe in such a way that beings may reap the consequences of their actions. Brahman remains impartial, akin to a cloud that pours rain equally everywhere; the variance in the crops is determined by the nature of the soil and seeds, not by the cloud itself.  'ब्रह्मणोहि देवादिरूपविषमजनोत्पादने विश्वसृष्टयादौ पर्जन्यस्य विषमाङ्करोत्पादनादौ तत्तद्दजिसापेक्षवत्त्ववत्तत्तत्कर्मसापेक्षत्वात् ।'

Another question that arises concerns the origin of the first creation: how was the nature of the first creation determined? The response is that creation is without any beginning and endless, and thus, the notion of a ""first"" creation is irrelevant in this context.

Thus ends the second part of the philosophy of srinivasa and nimbarka svabhavika bhedabheda. Please checkout part one also. ",10,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy),,0.99,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy)

It’s a casual relationship, and I don’t foresee it lasting long-term, as I’ll be moving to a different city soon, and we likely won’t stay in touch afterward.

We’ve hugged a few times, and recently she tried to kiss me, but I stopped her because I’m conflicted. On one hand, I enjoy her company, but on the other, I’m uncertain about the future and whether it’s ethically okay to engage in intimacy in a relationship that doesn’t seem to have a future.

As a practicing Hindu, I feel this is an important moral question, and I’m struggling to find clarity. How do I navigate this from a dharmic perspective? Is it wrong to get physically close with someone if I know the relationship is temporary?

Since i live in the dorms and only have a small shrine for my pujas, i really didn't have a maa durga idol so i lit a diya near a small cardboard art miniature which was oh soo beautiful. Long story short, the miniature caught fire and majority of it turned into ashes. 

Naturally, i believe it is ominous but more than that, i think maa might be angry with me and I really need help in regards to ways that i can apologise to her. This is a really desperate plea. 

For context, i only observed the fast today and I was idiotically vague about it. Did not eat as such but did not perform Puja in the morning or meditate because I was tired from last night. Do you all think it could be this? Whatever the reason may be, i really need some advice on this.

The Hindu subcontinent  has seen thousands of grand temples which were made to cater the humans, reach their ultimate goal and also for various other purposes. Unfortunately we faced too many invasions and in North India the temple culture has taken quite a hit. But still there are many places which are still alive because of their nature of conscreations and because of yogis and priests who took care of them. For transformation and  seeking one has to take the help of energy space like this or someone has to take serious strides in yoga(particularly kriya yoga) because unless you go beyond the mind and body you will keep changing directions. Once you taste something of the beyond you cannot fool yourself for long. Somewhere u will know where the real deal is even if you change your direction and hence you will keep coming back to it. This directory maps key energy spaces which have been verified by a group of advanced meditators(led by a man from nepal who is a yogi) from Isha.What verification here would mean is that you not only experience the different aspects of enrgy body of your own systems(the nadis, chakrasetc.) but you also understand how the space is functioning. I know that Sadhguru and Isha are not welcomed in this group which is fine but some(almost 90%) of these places are not related to Isha at all. It is just that the mediators went there and clearly experienced energy spaces and listed them for the larger use of the public. This work took about 2-3years for the group. Enromous amount of effort which i cannot write  or explain here went in this work. This is a phenomenonal effort to locate temples and samadhis of yogis near you. Temples and energy spaces are not about going there touching the floor and coming back, you must sit there and close your eyes to imbibe the energy otherwise it is good for your insta profile that u visited some great temple but u will gain nothing. The website has not listed anything related to description of energy on the website because you may go with an assumption into the temple or space which is not what you want. You should go with an intrigue only then a possibility to experience will come. Unless we change our behavior towards our temples we will not progress neither as a community nor as a nation. What happened in tirmula temple is an indirect consequence of our ignorance towards our temples and ignorance towards our inner dimension. We must transform ourselves to revive sanatan dharma. Today i see  internet Hindus are like reactions to Abrahamic religions which is quite concerning. Let us transform ourselves and the rest will eventually take care by itself. Namaskar.

A family member of mine has died unfairly, why did God not do anything to save him? Im going through financial problems, im praying to God for money everyday, hes still not answering my prayers. What do i do to make him hear my prayers?

How much selfishness is hidden in these words. You know that everyday thousands of people are going through unimaginable pain, they have lost so much. But still, only when that hardship strikes *you*, you feel bad and start to lose faith in God.

Praying to God, will not achieve anything on its own. Praying to God for selfish desires, even to think that those prayers will be heard is foolish. Is God some bank, where you go, deposit a request or loan and get money? Does God owe anything to you? Why, in any scenario, should he be indebted to you and give you as you please. The real thing which God wants you to do, is get up, and do your work yourself. Take control. But, do not turn egoistic doing so. It is not 'Leave everything to God and trust him to take control'. Nor is it 'Take control over my own decisions and act completely as you please.' It is 'Take control, and trust God to guide you on the right decision'.

I don't want moksha, I want to follow my desires, I want to follow my dreams, I want to fulfill my goals and ambitions, I don't want to have a ego death, Just want to be true to my self, And do things which give me Happiness .

These are the problems I have 

But recently the truth of uncertainty have struck me like lightning.

I have become more paranoid tham ever before.

I am afraid to love because I fear to losing them, but scares me more is the way I lose them because I have made a grave mistake of watching gore videos from a young age which made me scared of losing the things and people i would love especially, tragically.

There is a song lyrics which explains my situation.

""I feel so Disconnected from everyone, everyone around me. All i ever wanted was just to belong somewhere else than here""

I thought religion might be a way but Hinduism's main goal kinda goes against my own ways so I am in a place where I am confused if I should Worship God or Not.

And this have become so bad that I dropped the plan to stop smoking because it would help me Die faster because I have heard of that people who k!ll them selves have horrible consequences. Sometimes I feel like becoming a completely person but I don't want to it's like I am in the Edge of Insanity and I don't know what to do.

That's My Mental State.

Again another song comes in my mind which said

""Is Death the only Release?

Which for me means is it better to start again?

Quoting another song which actually explains my situation the best.

""My Lust for a new Beginning grows thick""

So, Is there any Solution for Me? Or I Should ""Live"" like this and Await My Death?

Karl doesn't know about any other religion except the religion he was born in. The ways of worshipping according to Karl's religion is to do regular prayers and rituals, and sacrifices of babies and animals in festivals. A person who has committed any crime like a murder shall be hung to death with intense pain and whosoever will persecute that criminal will be granted rewards by the god. 


Now, Karl has been conditioned to follow those morals and it's like quite a normal thing for him to do things that we consider harsh and heinous. He is not any kinda philosopher or a thinker, he is a potter who spends majority of his time in pottery and other time doing religious activities and spending time with family and friends.


Now the real question is, **""will he gain good karma or bad karma or something else""**? 

If he'll gain bad karma then he'll get more worse next life he's already into. Thus creating a never ending downstairs of getting worse lives.

It would be extremely rare for anyone like Karl to figure out that his religious guidelines doesn't works at all and are actually immoral.

V. Kane. At the end of a total of 6,358 pages across five volumes, the author has written an essay on what he considers the ""Fundamental Characteristics of Hindu Culture and Civilization"".  His list is as follows:

1) Though called by various names, God is One
2) Hinduism is tolerant of contrarian ideas
3) The self is non-different from the one Essence
4) There are the debts to Gods, Sages and Pitr
5) Four Purusharthas guide human pursuits
6) Society is classified into four Varnas
7) Life span is classified as four Ashramas
8) Karma and Punarjanma is believed by all
9) Ahimsa is a core value to be followed
10) Karma, Bhakti and Jnana are the three paths
11) Adhikari Bheda - spiritual gradation
12) Core is the vast Sanskrit Literature
13) Yoga as a physical practice
14) Philosophy of the six astika schools
15) Art, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting.

Well, I can see that some easy disagreements with this list maybe had in respect to points 3 and 11. It must also be said here that Kane himself comes with a strong bias towards Traditional Advaita. Point 1 may also be controversial in many regards.

I wonder what you guys think of this list. What would you want to add to it or rather remove from it? Any other comments you may have on it.

Now you can have your own opinion on the topic of Hindu gods being used as playable characters, but under my comment on that post there were many replies saying things like ""everything is brahman, the Gods are brahman, the characters (with the inappropriate designs) are also brahman, then why are you having a problem with it?""

I did not give a reply to them at that time but I randomly remembered that event today and decided to make this post for such lost souls with half baked knowledge of Advaita 

The amount of people that get into Advaita Vedanta and don't understand the difference between vyavahara and paramartha is hilarious 

They will hear things like ""there is nothing but God, you are God and the world is an illusion (and hence does not exist)"" from unauthorised (jholi wale babas) online who pose themselves as Advaita gurus and then they live in misunderstandings and misconceptions about Advaita and the world
 

There nothing but god(brahman), true

You are god(brahman), also true

But where? That is the question, you are brahman, but in paramartha, not in vyavahara 

Vyavahara is the truth that the jiva perceives under the influence of avidya(ignorance), this is the world that you and me see, feel and experience everyday, this is the world with the trees, the mountains and the oceans

Paramartha is the truth that remains when avidya is removed, this is the state of existance where there is nothing but brahman

Until the avidya is removed, you are in vyavahara, the things you see are true and distinct, in vyavahara there is dvaita(duality) everywhere and in everything, you are not your  father, delicious food on a plate and garbage on a plate is not the same thing

All of it becomes one, but where, in the state of paramartha not in the state of vyavahara 

Understand it like this, there is a very popular example used to explain Advaita

A man goes in a dark room and sees a snake on the ground, he turns on the light and find out that it was just a rope and he was perceiving it as a snake because of darkness 

Now if I ask you if the snake was true, you will probably say no, but if we go back to our example at the point where there was darkness infornt of the person, was the snake true to him then? Obviously the snake was true to him at that moment of time when there was darkness, when the darkness was removed only then the snake became false

Many people who learn advaita fail to realise that they are still the man standing in the darkness, they forget that they are still surrounded by avidya and till there is avidya the world is real, just like till there was darkness the snake was real

When avidya is removed (the light is turned on) only then the world will become false, and at that moment the person attains moksha

Just because you have learned a little about Advaita does not mean that your avidya is removed 



You cannot live according to the state of paramartha where everything is equal, it is not something you can follow, it is something that you have to achieve

For example 

The world is round, but can you act like if it was round?

You cannot, because you are too small and because of your small size the world will always appear flat to you and you will have to act like as if it is flat, you know it is round but you haven't realised it

Even if you want to act like if it was round you cannot because of your size, the ground under your feet will always appear flat to you and you will have to live like if it is flat

But yeah, while living in the flat world you can do one thing, you can make a spaceship, leave the earth, see it from the outside and realise its roundness

Similarly, everything is one(brahman) but you cannot act like as if everything is the same even if you want to, if you try to act like it that would also mean that food and feces should be the same to you and your wife and your mother should also be the same to you,

Try doing it, all you will achieve from it is being mentally ill

Till you live in vyavahara the world will always appear dual to you and you will have to live like the world is filled with dualities, due to avidya it will always appear like this 

Vyavahara is filled with dualities, it has good and bad, appropriate and inappropriate, dharma and adharma, you live in vyavahara and you will have to live according to vyavahara,

But one thing you can do while living in vyavahara is do bhkati, attain jnana and perform your karmas according to dharma, this way you can dissolve your ego and realise the oneness of brahman by attain moksha and being free from vyavahara by leaving it, like a spaceship leaving the earth and you being able to see the roundness of earth

Another thing is that in vyavahara due to it's dualities, you and ishvara are also not the same, there is a dvaita bhava (dual nature) between you and Vishnu/Shiva/Shakti, you are one with Vishnu/Shiva/Shakti only when you have reached paramartha ie attained moksha, it is through intense bhakti that you dissolve your ego and attain moksha, hence uniting with your ishta and becoming one with brahman

Knowing about brahman and realising it are two different things you will have to understand that, just like knowing the Earth is round and realising it's roundness by leaving it are two different things

Now is vyavahara an illusion?

No, it's just that your perspective is limited, the sun is round but from Earth it seems circular , is sun looking like a circle an illusion? No, it's just that your perspective is limited because of your distance from the sun 

Does it looking like a circle make it non existent, also no because if I was non existent how we would have been able to see it in the first place

Similarly the world is brahman, but it looks like the world because our perspective is limited by maya, it is not an illusion, nor is it non existent, it's just that it does not appear to us like how it really is because of our reduced perspectives, breaking free from maya and gaining the true perspective to see the reality as it is is liberation (moksha),

Like becoming bigger than the sun and seeing it's roundness 


Now coming at the beginning of the post, if someone makes an inappropriate, let's say pornographic imagery of Hindu Gods and Goddesses, it's not the same as a normal appropriate painting of Hindu deities 

Everything is brahman, but only when you have reached the paramartha, till you have avidya, you will be in vyavahara and you will have to live according to what is appropriate and oppose what is inappropriate 

Just assuming that everything is one is not removal of avidya, nor is it liberation

Removal of avidya comes through intense bhakti and meditation which leads to jnana, it does not come just by assuming things ",63,True,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy),,0.49,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy)

Are you tired of non hindus especially muslims who try to undermine our dharma by saying that Lord Brahma married his daughter, Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvathy at the age of 8 and Lord Krishna married Goddess Rukmini at the age of 8 and other things. Here is a complete breakdown of debunking their claims. 

Lord Brahma married his daughter Goddess Sarasvati. If you go by that logic, according to the Quran, Adam was created from clay, and Eve was created from Adam (Surah An-Nisa (4:1)). That means eve was daughter of adam since allah created eve from adam and eve was adam's wife quran(2.35) that means its and incest so all the prophets who came from them are by products of incest

Lord Shiva married goddess Parvathy at the age of 8

Chapter 22 verse 52 or go to page no 558

it clearly says goddess Parvati did meditate for 3000 years before getting married to lord Shiva

so the claim that she married at the age of 8 is false

now Shri Krishna married Goddess Rukmini at the age of 16

Harivamsa purana Vishnu Parva chapter 59  verse 35

harivamsa purana is also purana about Lord Krishna

Now the claim Lord Ram married Goddess sita at the age of 6

If we assume that Goddess Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage, and considering that  Sita had three younger sisters—Urmila, Mandavi, and Shrutakirti—this would imply that Shrutakirti, being the youngest, was around 3 years old. Shrutakirti was married to Shatrughna during the same ceremony that united Rama with Sita, which means she would have been married at the age of 3. At that age, most children are not even capable of fully comprehending language or basic concepts, let alone the concept of marriage.Therefore, if we accept the premise that Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage, it would logically follow that Shrutakirti, who was the youngest princess, would have been younger than 6 years old when she got married, which is absurd. Additionally, considering that all four couples—Rama and Sita, Lakshmana and Urmila, Bharata and Mandavi, and Shatrughna and Shrutakirti—were married at the same time, it is highly improbable that Shrutakirti, at such a young age, would have been married alongside her older siblings. Even if it is true at the time of marriage Lord Ram was 12 years old so it is a child marriage and the responsibility is in the hands of their parents and not like your prophet who married aisha when he was 53 and she was 6

Here’s a breakdown of the timeline:

The Prophet was born in 570 CE, and he migrated to Medina in 622 CE at the age of 52.

He married Aisha shortly after the migration, in 623 CE, when he was about 53 years old.",16,True,Debunking misconceptions,,0.96,False,Debunking misconceptions

>The Rishis said, 'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.'""

>Sauti said, 'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three sena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a Vahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form a Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms, as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy.

According to Udyoga and Bhisma Parva the Pandavas and Kauravas have 7 and 11 Akshauhini sena, respectively. 

This gives us a total 18 Akshauhini which consists of

1,968,300 Infantry Soldiers

1,180,980 Cavalry Soldiers

787,320 Chariots (one driver one warrior) 

787,320 Elephants (one driver one warrior)

Total = 4,723,920 people

However even if there 4 people on an elephant or more, the maximum will still be 6 million or 7 million, reasonably.

I was unable to focus on daily tasks, and also felt like I was repeatedly feeling the craving for pornography, which I ended up not watching, though I did end up seeing content on Instagram that stimulated me to get rid of the repeated thoughts. This lasted for about 2 days to the point at which on day 6 during the night I ended up deciding to do it. I did not watch any pornography but it got hard to resist the urge, and as a result I felt bad. 

Before doing it I promised bagavam that I would after it restard not Masterbating for the rest of the time, and also cut out caffeine as a result of what I did.

Srunivasacharya was the disciple of Nimbarkacharya and one of the most prominent ācāryas in Nimbarka Sampradaya. His philosophical framework is known as Svābhāvika Bhedābheda. At the command of his preceptor, he wrote Vedanta-Kaustubha, which is more than a gloss on the Brahma-Sūtra-Bhāşya known as Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha of Nimbārkācārya, this fact is recorded by himself-
'तदाज्ञया तदुक्तवर्त्मना तदनुग्रहकामेन तच्छिष्येण मया मृदुमितपदो वेदान्तकौस्तुभस्त‌द्भावार्थप्रकाशको विदुषामुपकाराय विरच्यते।'

""At his command, I, his disciple desirous to win his favour, am composing Vedānta-Kaustubha, which is composed of soft and limited words and which express the purport of that (Vedānta Pārijāta Saurabha), which is in accordance with the way or path demonstrated by him, with a desire of obtaining his favour and for benefitting the wise.""

He is Pāñcajanya (Lord Visnu's conch) himself, as recorded by Śrī Puruṣottamācārya (4th acharya of the sampradayik lineage) stating that the Vedānta pārijāta saurabha was explained by Śrīnivāsa, who is the incarnation of Pāñcajanya, as revealed by the reverend preceptor Viśvācārya.

ETYMOLOGY
Svābhāvika Bhedābheda (also known as Dvaitādvaita and as Bhinnābhinna) is a sanskrit term that means natural relationship of differences and identity. 

﻿The term ""Svābhāvika"" signify the relationship is not brought about by any external agency, and therefore it cannot be dispensed with. An adventitious relation can be finished away by removing the cause or agency (upādhi) which has brought it, but what is natural cannot be taken away.

The term ""Bhedābheda"" represents the metaphysical relationship between the ultimate reality and other metaphysical entities. The literal translation of Bheda is differences and Abheda is identity. This relationship is characterized by simultaneous differences and non-differences. 


Ontology
Srinivasacharya’s philosophy, Svābhāvika Bhedābheda, articulates a threefold reality, distinguished as Brahman, Cit and Acit - ""तत्त्वं तावन्त्रिविधम्। चिदचिद्ब्रह्मभेदात्।""

Brahman: The metaphysical ultimate reality, object to be enquired into, and supreme controller.

Cit: The sentient individual soul (Jivātman), enquirer, enjoyer.

Acit: The non-sentient universe; the original cause of nescience, and the object to be enjoyed.
﻿ 
In this framework, Brahman is the only svatantra tattva (independent reality), while the existence and activities of the individual soul and the universe are dependent on Brahman, and are regarded as paratantra tattva (dependent reality) स्वाधीनपराधीनौ ब्रह्मजीवात्मानावित्यर्थः ॥
Individual soul and non-sentient universe are considered as a part of Brahman (aṃśā-aṃśī bhāva), using the part-whole analogy. However, this ""part"" should not be interpreted as a literal fragment, but rather as a manifestation of Brahman's power (śakti).

1fzr4fi,So far my favorite stotram: 15 verses on consciousness ,Ok-Summer2528,2024-10-09 14:14:33+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1fzr4fi/so_far_my_favorite_stotram_15_verses_on/,6,/r/hinduism/comments/1fzr4fi/so_far_my_favorite_stotram_15_verses_on/,hinduism,"There is a radiance that remains undimmed through all moments of light and darkness; the One within, the end of all light and all darkness. || 1

(“The end of light and darkness” meaning that awareness is the field in which all experiences of light, darkness, or anything else arise and dissolve)

That One is the Highest Divinity, the innate essence of all beings and states; for all that comes into being is nothing but the expression of its sovereign Power. || 2

(Through the power of Vimarsha all action and all phenomena is nothing but the direct expression of the power of consciousness. Since it cannot be limited whatsoever, and is the most fundamental reality, it must be necessity be the primal cause of all phenomena and experience)

The Goddess (Energy) never wants to be separate from the One who holds Her; they are eternally one Being — as inseparable as fire and its heat. || 3

(The Goddess is the representation of Para-Shakti, the absolute autonomous power of awareness(svatantrya) arising from Vimarsha. Bhairava represents the static and attributless aspect of awareness which is pure Prakasha. The innate power of Vimarsha is a potentiality “held within” Bhairava.)

(As such these are not at all two separate principles but just a way to describe the two most fundamental functions of awareness: that of illumination(Prakasha) and self-reflection (Vimarsha) )

That Lord is none other than Bhairava, whose role is to sustain (bhṛ) the world;
for through his Power, everything exists as a reflection in the mirror of the Self. || 4

(“In the mirror of the Self” means the world arises within awareness as a result of Vimarsha. He does not literally mean the Self is reflected in some external object like a mirror.)

That Supreme Goddess (Parā Devī) is none other than his longing to be intimately aware of his own nature, whose fullness & perfection in all beings is neither trifling nor significant. || 5

(This longing is a natural impulse arising spontaneously out of love, the impulse of awareness to be self-aware)

This God is eternally eager for the sweetness of love-play with this Goddess; [through it,] the Lord simultaneously accomplishes the wonderfully varied creations and dissolutions [of all the objects of our experience]. || 6

This Absolute [Consciousness] which accomplishes what seems impossible has autonomous sovereign awake awareness as its nature. || 7

It is said that the defining feature of insentience is a limited power of illumination; so Awareness is distinct from insentience by the fact that it is unlimited. || 8

(“Insentience” here refers to any limited powers of the Jiva such as the senses and mind. Awareness is distinct from these in the sense that it cannot be limited.)

(This should not be misunderstood as saying the Jiva is seperate from awareness, as I have talked about before the Jiva is a limited “contraction” of the uncontracted powers of awareness. Just because it is a contraction does not mean it exists as something other than the direct manifestation of consciousness.)

Thus, [the cycles of] creation and dissolution are innate [to Awareness], existing as subdivisions of its innate power of Freedom; as expressions of its true nature. || 9

For within these [cycles] there exist an infinite variety of painful and pleasurable worlds: higher, lower, and parallel [to this one] -- [all] aspects of this [unrestrained power of freedom to create]. || 10

The state of being ignorant of all this is itself a construct of that Freedom. The cyclical flux [of this autonomous Being] is indeed terrifying to those who are unconscious. || 11

(So even ignorance itself, like everything else, is a creation of Atma's freedom. What else could it possibly be?)

By what means [does one overcome ignorance]? Through His grace? Through the power of a mantra? Through the testimony of your guru? Or through the scriptures of the Supreme Lord? || 12

Recognition of the nature of reality is divine liberation. That state of fullness experienced by the awakened ones is taught to be jīvanmukti (living liberation). || 13

(As Abhinava tells us plainly: “In our way, the ultimate goal is simply recognition of one’s own fundamental nature. That is what is most worth seeking in this world.”)

(Commentator adds: Liberation is the manifestation of one’s innate freedom, bursting with wonder at the experience of the sense of ‘I’ encompassing everything, i.e. recognition of the nature of reality as unsurpassed consciousness.)

These two states — bondage and liberation — both derive from the nature of the Highest Divinity; they are indivisible — one implies the other — for there can in reality be no division within the Highest Divinity. || 14

Thus one should cultivate & cherish Bhairava, dwelling within the trident-and-lotus-throne whose prongs are the powers of Willing, Knowing, and Acting. || 15

(Cultivating Bhairava means, utilizing any of the 4 upayas, a Jiva comes to recognize and experience the vast fullness of consciousness which is called Bhairava)

I am doing a research project into the lives of childfree (CF) and antinatalist (AN) women of color. To start off, I am asking for participation from everyone in the broader CF and AN communities, to get a baseline on shared experiences and perspectives.

Being childfree is seen as a personal choice not to have children, whereas antinatalism is an ethical principle that it is immoral to have children.

My research question is: What specific challenges, including cultural stigma, familial pressure, religious beliefs, and economic expectations, do childfree and antinatalist women of color face in pronatalist communities?

I have a scholarly reviewed and approved survey to share. It should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, and the answers are anonymous. If you would like to participate further, there is an option to share your email address. It is not a requirement.

This is specifically for those who identify as CF or AN.

Thank you for your participation!

>There is a great discussion going on as to whether the aggregate of materials we call the body is the cause of manifestation of the force we call the soul, thought, etc., or whether it is the thought that manifests this body.

Then:

>There are schools of modern thought which hold that what we call thought is simply the outcome of the adjustment of the parts of the machine which we call body.

Swami Vivekananda rejects this notion by saying:

>To say that the force called soul is the outcome of the combinations of the molecules of the body is putting the cart before the horse. How did the combinations come; where was the force to make them? If you say that some other force was the cause of these combinations, and soul was the outcome of that matter, and that soul — which combined a certain mass of matter — was itself the result of the combinations, it is no answer.

This is later followed by:

>To say, therefore, that the thought forces manifested by the body are the outcome of the arrangement of molecules and have no independent existence has no meaning; neither can force evolve out of matter.

**My question: At first it** ***may*** **seem to make sense to you, but isn't this exactly what happened? Coincidences, which lead to life. He doesn't even take this into account, probably because it leaves it the question unanswered, but that is the point, it IS unanswered. We still do not know it for sure.**

**Does it mean something else or am I missing something?**

Sanātana Dharma (Devanagari: सनातन धर्म meaning ""eternal dharma"") is the original name of Hinduism. It is considered to be the oldest living religion in the world.  Hinduism is often called a ""way of life"", and anyone sincerely following that way of life can consider themselves to be a Hindu.

If you are new to Hinduism or to this sub, review this material before making any new posts!

* [Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/about/rules) are strictly enforced.
* Our [Hinduism Starter Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/starter_pack/) is a great place to begin.
* Check our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/faq/) before posting any questions.  While we enjoy answering questions, answering the same questions over and over gets a bit tiresome.
* We have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/wiki/index/) as well.
* Use the search function to see past posts on any particular topic or questions.
* You can also see our [Archive of Important Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/?f=flair_name%3A%22Archive%20Of%20Important%20Posts%22) or previous [Quality Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/?f=flair_name%3A%22Quality%20Discussion%22)

We also recommend reading [What Is Hinduism](https://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/what-is-hinduism) (a free introductory text by Himalayan Academy) if you would like to know more about Hinduism and don't know where to start.

If you are asking a specific scriptural question, please include a source link and verse number, so responses can be more helpful.

In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).) Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. 

In terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), you can choose whatever works best for you. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).

Lastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. 

###Here is a section from our FAQ that deserves to be repeated here:

Disclaimer: Sanatana Dharma is a massive, massive religion in terms of scope/philosophies/texts, so this FAQ will only be an overview. If you have any concerns about the below content, please send us a modmail.

###**What are the core beliefs of all Hindus?**

* You are not your body or mind, but the indweller witness Atma.
* The Atma is divine.
* Law of Karma (natural law of action and effect)
* Reincarnation - repeated birth/death cycles of the physical body
* Escaping the cycle of reincarnation is the highest goal (moksha)

###**Why are there so many different schools/philosophies/views?  Why isn't there a single accepted view or authority?**

Hinduism is a religion that is inclusive of **everyone**.  The ultimate goal for all Sanatani people is *moksha*, but there is incredible diversity in the ways to attain it.  See this post : [Vastness and Inclusiveness of being Hindu](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/ese8rc/vastness_and_inclusiveness_of_being_hindu/).  Hinduism is like a tree springing from the core beliefs above and splitting up into innumerable traditions/schools/practices.  It is natural that there are different ways to practice just like there are many leaves on the same tree.

###**Do I have to blindly accept the teachings?  Or can I question them?**
Sanatanis are not *believers*, but *seekers*.  We seek Truth, and part of that process is to question and clarify to remove any misunderstandings.  The Bhagavad Gita is a *dialog* between a teacher and student; the student Arjuna questions the teacher Krishna.  In the end Krishna says ""I have taught you; now do what you wish"".  There is no compulsion or edict to believe anything.  Questioning is welcome and encouraged.

###**Debates and disagreements between schools**
Healthy debates between different sampradayas and darshanas are accepted and welcomed in Hinduism.  Every school typically has a documented justification of their view including refutations of common objections raised by other schools.  It is a shame when disagreements with a view turn into disrespect toward a school and/or its followers.

###**Unity in diversity**
This issue of disrespect between darshanas is serious enough to warrant a separate section.  Diversity of views is a great strength of Hinduism.  Sanatanis should not let this become a weakness!  We are all part of the same rich tradition.

Here is a great post by [-_Gandalf_-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-_Gandalf_-/) : [Unite! Forget all divisions](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/13pqnh4/unite_forget_all_divisions/).  It is worth repeating here.

Forget all divisions! Let us unite! Remember, while letting there be the diversity of choice in the Dharma: Advaita, Dvaita, Vishistadvaita, etc*, we should always refer to ourselves as ""Hindu"" or ""Sanatani"" and not just ""Advaiti"" or any other specific name. Because, we are all Hindus / Sanatanis. Only then can we unite.

Let not division of sects destroy and eliminate us and our culture. All these names are given to different interpretations of the same culture's teachings. Why fight? Why call each other frauds? Why call each other's philosophies fraud? Each must stay happy within their own interpretation, while maintaining harmony and unity with all the other Sanatanis, that is unity! That is peace! And that is how the Dharma shall strive and rise once again.

Let the Vaishnavas stop calling Mayavad fraud, let the Advaitis let go of ego, let the Dvaitis embrace all other philosophies, let the Vishistadvaitis teach tolerance to others, let the Shaivas stop intolerance, let there be unity!

Let all of them be interpretations of the same teachings, and having the similarity as their base, let all the schools of thought have unity!

A person will reach moksha one day, there is no other end. Then why fight? Debates are supposed to be healthy, why turn them into arguments? Why do some people disrespect Swami Vivekananda? Let him have lived his life as a non-vegetarian, the point is to absorb his teachings. The whole point is to absorb the good things from everything. So long as this disunity remains, Hinduism will keep moving towards extinction.

ISKCON is hated by so many people. Why? Just because they have some abrahamic views added into their Hindu views. Do not hate. ISKCON works as a bridge between the west and the east. Prabhupada successfully preached Sanatan all over the world, and hence, respect him!

Respecting Prabhupada doesn't mean you have to disrespect Vivekananda and the opposite is also applicable.

Whenever you meet someone with a different interpretation, do not think he is something separate from you. Always refer to yourself and him as ""Hindu"", only then will unity remain.

Let there be unity and peace! Let Sanatan rise to her former glory!

Om Shanti. ,ImportanceHopeful895,2024-11-01 13:17:08+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gh55eu/everyone_must_read_this_obituary_of_late_shree/,36,/r/hinduism/comments/1gh55eu/everyone_must_read_this_obituary_of_late_shree/,hinduism,"After more than a month in the cardiac care centre (CCU) and a private room in AIIMS, I am discharged. My wife, Suparna, has performed a modern-day Savitri-Satyavan, aided by the skills of the doctors. As time goes, a month is fleeting. But being virtually wiped off the face of the earth is not. I manage to get the daily limericks going from the hospital. So people don’t necessarily notice. My frequent co-author, Aditya Sinha, keeps some of the columns going. More people don’t notice.

For me, the external world is restricted to a thin sliver of a window (in the room). I can see a pipe in the building outside. A monkey religiously clambers up every morning. It is restricted to counting the IV drops as they pass through the cannula. Drip, drip. It is restricted to requesting Harish to bring the urinal or commode. Sometimes, the bed gets soiled. Just a lump of flesh stretched out, stripped of normal norms of shame and modesty. Sometimes, in a wheelchair or a hospital trolley, I am carted from one building to another, passing through the melee, through the sun shining, through the birds chirping on the green trees. There is a world outside that exists. What if I am not there? What indeed?

“A new book has arrived. Would you like to read it?” asks Suparna. The book happens to be “100 places to see after you die,” by Ken Jennings. We smile at each other. How singularly inappropriate! I don’t feel like reading, even when I can. I don’t feel like watching TV, even when I can. The same boring news, the same boring high-decibel debates. It all seems so transient and puerile. But so am I, transient and puerile, a dot that might have been wiped off. In that event, what would have happened? A few condolences, perhaps even from important people. “Irreparable loss.” Perhaps a posthumous Padma Bhushan or Padma Vibhushan. A few obituaries. What will they mention? Trade work of 1980-s, law reform of 1990-s, State work of 2000-s, railway reforms of 2015, even resignation from Rajiv Gandhi Institute in 2005? Who remembers? Nothing seminal about such work. Had a role in the rat race, was temporarily read and passed into oblivion, buried in journal archives.

Perhaps the Purana Project, left incomplete. Manmatha Nath Dutt was reborn, to finish the Purana work. I will be reborn. But I hope not for this. Irreparable loss at the age of 70, when life’s productivity is as good as over? In another ten years, what social value will I bring? Can it be measured, quantified, imputed for? I give up the thought, too complicated. There are lives my life has touched, improved, even bruised. If they get to know, they may remember, with fondness and bitterness. Such people don’t write obituaries.

No social loss, not much. Private loss is possible. To whom? My sons have been abroad after graduating from school, more American now than Indian. “Will I hop onto a plane?” For what? You know precious little about India. You will be less of a help and more of a hindrance. There will be a time to hop onto the plane. Not yet, not now. Not in time for the last hug, but in time for the funeral rites. At best, send money, if needed. It was no different for my parents and me. However, that was spread across different cities in India. This is transcontinental. That was physical photographs. I will leave a digital imprint. Where is that old black and white photograph of my parents? Haven’t seen it for a while. Once in a while, they will look at those digital imprints. Some remembrance, some childhood memories, some nostalgia. No permanent loss. None to friends and colleagues either. A few drop in. However, a month is a long time. People get bored and forget. Why do they drop in and want to hear about what happened and when? Weak and withering, why am I supposed to repeat every trivia? Genuine interest, or a vicarious pleasure in death and disease? I want to put everything down on a piece of paper. I can offer it to them to read. Suparna vetoes the idea. Very rude. In the event, the only personal loss will be Suparna’s. It matters nothing to anyone else.

I think of Yayati. I have been unfair to him, interpreting it as desire for sensual pleasures. It is deeper. It is hankering after control over the physical body, the craving. Will I trade my life for that of Harish? Will he? Was “prayopavesa” such a terrible idea? Some animals still practise it. I spend my time with such conversations in solitude, thinking about Salman Rushdie’s “Knife” and “Ashtavakra Gita,” recently co-authored with Hindol Sengupta. “O Janaka! Give up attachment.” That’s easy, easier. “O Janaka! Disassociate yourself from your body.” Impossible. Except when, under local anesthesia, some surgical process is going on. The sub-conscious mind or hallucination? For a fleeting moment, amidst a blaze of lights, you seem to be whirled around the stellar system, separate from the body. A delirious moment of bliss. A moment you would like to recreate and replicate, but can’t. It is not time for erasure. The body will heal in due course. I am not sure about the beating the mind has taken, I think for the better.",4,True,Hindū News,,0.97,False,Hindū News

Due to maya, prakriti seems to exist. Just like how clay and pot appear different but only truth is clay. 
Purusha(atman) in a way is brahman but separated due to ignorance/ego which gives birth to different desires and then karma theory begins.

But my question is how ego/ignorance came into existence first place..

I don't get concept of god too. All I understand is brahman is just too vague for most people to understand, so god is just our proxy to understand the brahman.

The verse is as below:

>आत्मलिंगमविश्वरूपमादिमध्यानन्त्स्वयम् जीवाजीवदैवदैत्यमसर्वरूपमनिरूपम् |

>आदिब्रह्मामहाविष्णोश्चहमेवोसदाशिवम् विद्यालक्ष्मीपराशक्तिपरमात्मानोश्चपरब्रह्मोहम् ||

My guess of translation:

आत्मलिंगम-विश्वरूपम-आदिमध्यानन्त्स्वयम् - ""I am Atmalinga (shiva), visharoop (vishnu), the beginning, middle and the endless self""

जीवाजीव-दैवदैत्यम-सर्वरूपमनिरूपम् - ""I am life, non-life, divine, demonic, all-formed and without any form""

आदिब्रह्मा-महाविष्णोश्च-अहामेवो-सादशिवम् - ""I am the primordial Brahma, the great Vishnu and the eternal Shiva""

विद्या-लक्ष्मी-पराशक्ति-परमात्मानोश्च-परब्रह्मोहम्  - ""I am the knowledge (Saraswati), Lakshmi, Shakti, parmatman and parabrahman""

  
And moreover, Who/What is the ""I"" here?

I have an almost non-existent understanding of Hindusim, and this question was inspired solely by an ""Introduction to Hindusim"" seminar at my University. That is the level of my understanding.

Are there malevolent forces in Hinduism? Something equivalent to what Abrahamic faiths would call demons. If so, what is their origin? As I understand it, all ""things"" and gods are derived from a single Supreme Being. And so, are demons also an aspect of that Being? If so, what are the implications for the nature of the Supreme Being? Is it simultaneously good and bad, is it neither good nor bad, is it a mistake to try to reconcile a human understanding of morality with the nature of a Supreme Being?

I suppose this has become less a question about demons, and more a question about tangible incarnations of what we could call ""evil"" and the problem of pain in Hinduism.

I first leant of ISKCON in the early 90s, when I discovered Bhagavd Gita As It Is and the ISKCON kirtan audio casettes that were left to me by my father. We have been a proper Vaishnava family, more in the North Indian way, so we were never ""deekshit"" in the ISKCON path. Our family Guru has been Shri 1008 Ganga Giri Ji Maharaj, and ours was a rather  religiously tolerant family. This disclaimer is important because I am trying to say we have no bias towards ISKCON. 

Later in life, I got opportunities to visit their many temples in India and outside. In fact, many times their temples were the only connect to the Vaishnavism while being outside. 

You may not agree with their interpretation of things, but no one can deny that have been a net positive not only for Sanatan, but for the world! The world is a better place because of their existence. 

Find me one person who can visit their temple, look at the amazing murtis in the eyes for 30 seconds, and can say ""This is not a house of God"". Or someone who can listen to their Kirtans and not get goosebumps and feel a connect to the divine. A place does not just come alive with divine grace without a lot of sadhana going on behind it. I can vouch that Iskcon temples are such places. 

Sanatan by definition is an amalgamation of widely diverse philosophical positions. I have myself found myself attracted to Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda - Ramakrishna Paramhamsa Ji, Osho, Jiddu Krishnamurthy among many others. I have learnt something from everyone. The diversity of Sanatan is a reflection of the infite glories of the God himself. We can not define anything narrowly and say anything else outside of this is not Sanatan. 

Anyways, I will just repeat myself - The world is a better place with ISKCON in it, and I wish we have 1000 more ISKCONs! Jai Sri Radhe! ",51,True,Admiration of other Hindū denominations/scholars,,0.85,False,Admiration of other Hindū denominations/scholars

And if china invented fireworks, then how come our scriptures (which are way older) have references to fireworks?

Growing up in a neighborhood initially designated for Indians during the apartheid era but later when the laws were abolished, accommodated everyone, I was surrounded by a vibrant mix of Indians, Coloureds, and Africans(I’m African or Black, as we are called around the world) 

Naturally, my school was a microcosm of this diversity, where we celebrated each other’s traditions with enthusiasm although with little understanding. I think most kids at school were just happy to stay at home (or go to events centered around the holidays) and not come to school but either way, Eid, Ramadan, Diwali, and Christian holidays were all cherished events. I fondly recall our Hindu neighbours’ Diwali firework displays, which we affectionately dubbed “Hindu Christmas”. The joy and warmth of those moments remain etched in my memory. 

Little did I know that life would lead me to develop a profound connection with Hinduism. Diwali now holds a deeper significance for me, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness, both within and without.

How do you celebrate Diwali? What traditions and memories make this festival special for you?

Please comment if it makes sense. 

So hanuman had the ashirvad that he will live till the name of Ram lives. But in only last 10-15 years i have seen a tremendous change in people's worship pattern. People prefer to worship hanuman instead of Shri Ram. Take the example of hanuman chalisa or hanuman bhajans or anything. They are more popular than Ram bhajans or Ram stuti. Most of the hindus who worship regularly remember hanuman chalisa but very few of them remember Ram stuti. Even if people are taking Ram's name in between it is just for formality. Like ""Ram doot atulit baldhama"" Etc. 

I just want to point out that hindu's are focusing on hanuman worship which hanuman will never like. He will always say that please take Ram's name, I am just a sevak. 
This is because many texts tell that hanuman will complete wishes, he gives bal buddhi vidya, which is true. Be he does it only when you worship Ram and not him. And there are rarely any texts which shows how ram bhakti will benefit you. 
In kalyug, people run towards benefits rather than pure bhakti. 

See diwali is popular because Ram came to ayodhya on same day. But now it is more about laxmi pooja etc. because laxmi gives money. People welcome laxmi on diwali and very few people think about Ram. 

If these things continue then may be in next 100-200 years, Ram name will be completely gone. And then there will be no reason for Hanuman to stay here.

But not long after, another argument broke out, even louder than before. In a moment of frustration and anger, I said things I’m really ashamed of. I threatened to break the moorti (idol) of God, called God names, and even said I’d burn the moorti. I’m not sure why I let myself go there, but now I feel terrible.

I want to apologize, not only to my family but also to Ma Lakshmi. Those words didn’t come from a place of true intention—I was just caught up in the anger of the moment. I’m struggling with a lot of guilt and wish I could take it all back.

So I guess by that logic we should all go to a forest and do what Sri Ram on Diwali instead of celebrating with loved ones with sweets and puja?!😂🤦

At this point, Mr. Prashant is running out of things to criticise Hindus on. His whole personality is based on negating every single practice of Hindus to reform it into a dry, pseudo-philosophy academic exercise sucking out all the joy and community from it.

Diwali is celebrated as an occasion of Sri Ram’s return to Ayodhya, doesn’t have anything to do with forest dwelling period of his life. Mr. Prashant is a bitter, angry man for no reason.

I am currently residing in Abu Dhabi and live in an area where there’s not many Indians. This is my family’s first Diwali at this house. 

On the 28th of October (first day of Diwali) we drew a small rangoli outside our door, within our home’s personal space and found it smeared by someone by the evening. This was highly disturbing as it was nothing extravagant, not colourful and made respectfully, not causing any nuisance to our neighbours. 

We let this go and drew another one early morning the next day at the same place around 7:15 AM only to find it vandalised by 8:00 AM and again around 9:00 AM (after I redrew it)

I then reached out to the security and wrote a mail to the administrator as advised. We’d asked for the CCTV footage but could not gain access to it as per property rules. There had been no incidents since then until again today evening. I’m attaching the images of the smeared rangoli below. 

This has been highly disturbing as it’s a breach of our personal space, and I honestly feel extremely uneasy. Would anyone know what further action I can take, given where I’m currently living. ",58,False,Question - General,,0.99,False,Question - General

We ask them for health, strength, guidance to moksha, etc. We confide to them our deepest fears, secrets, and generally may just talk about our day or what's going on. Is it okay to also just ask them ""how are you?"" I know they care and love us so much, and I guess even though they are perfect and literally are god, can we ask them how are they too? Like I know they can't outright respond but I guess out of love can we silently ask them too how are they? Or is it a stupid idea? I know God is beyond feelings, beyond time, and other human concepts, but is it wrong to care in that way?

Thank you

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind answers, I thought I was doing something really stupid. I asked someone about it before I wrote my post on reddit, and they said that god can feel things but they don't really need it, so it wouldn't make sense. They said we can only show love through obedience. I felt like I was wrong, so Im glad I have your support on this. I'm gonna keep doing it because I truly believe everyone deserves that care and love of someone genuinely checking in on them. Maybe one day I'll get a direct answer.

3. Day 3 - Gai Tihar and Laxmi Puja: On the third day, cows are worshipped, and in the evening, people perform Laxmi Puja to invite the goddess of wealth into their homes. Homes are decorated with lights and colorful rangolis.

4. Day 4 - Govardhan Puja: The fourth day is dedicated to the worship of oxen and is also associated with the Govardhan Puja, where people create a mound of cow dung symbolizing the Govardhan Hill.

5. Day 5 - Bhai Tika: The final day celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. Sister put 7 different color of Tikas in brother forhead (each color symbolizes various aspect of life like Money, health, happiness, long life etc) & also offers garland of flowers.Flower should be Makhmali (Globe amaranth) and Gurdauli (Chrysanthemum).Sisters pray for their brothers' long life and prosperity, while brothers give gifts in return.

Most scriptures for me are not very literal, neither do they present as completelu historical book. Ramayana, Mahabharat have supernatural elements and illustration which is hard to understand through a rational mind and I believe it should be taken as more a of abstract  and a apotheosis cuz proving those supernatural elements is unreasonable. 

For me my central aastha is on parameshwara, and directly trying to understand his personalities or what we call Devas and isvara. I am cultural but not as much as many present here and the practices have more historical, heritage and traditional value to them instead of spiritual. Spirituality occurs when I do meditation for them rather than rituals.

My ista devi is Bhadra kali. I connect with her personality and embodiment of nature very well and also understand the essence of love in her destructive form. But I guess rituals generally aren't always my thing as they feel more by the book than heart.  I want to practice dharma through bonding with universe as whole. For me sadhana is a better form of bhakti than upsana. I am more of person that works on reason than faith, not that faith isn't important. But for me God is us and we are him always connected. To understand oneself through your own identity and practices is more elevating than rituals and practices. What sect do I belong to?

For the past 8 years, I’ve been a humble sadhak of Kala Bhairava, a powerful roop  of  Shiva. Known as the protector of dharma, he is fierce yet deeply compassionate to those who seek his guidance. People often see him as intense, and he does carry that power—representing kala (time) and the natural end of all things. But beyond this, he is a guardian, removing avidya (ignorance) and giving shakti to those on a spiritual path.

Alongside my devotion, Since I also practice astrology, I see Kala Bhairava’s energy at work in these cosmic cycles, reminding us that, like time, he is ever-present, guiding us through the twists and turns of life. For anyone who approaches him with a pure heart, he brings strength, courage, and clarity.

Here are some key hypotheses and interpretations:

*Ancient Hindu Texts:*

1. *Upanishads*: Describe multiple universes (lokas) within the cosmic egg (Brahmanda).
2. *Puranas*: Mention multiple universes (bhuvanas) within the infinite cosmos.
3. *Mahabharata*: Describes the concept of multiple worlds (lokas) and universes (bhuvanas).

*Hindu Philosophical Traditions:*

1. *Advaita Vedanta*: Proposes the idea of multiple universes (jagats) within the ultimate reality (Brahman).
2. *Vishishtadvaita Vedanta*: Describes multiple universes (lokas) within the divine realm (Vaikuntha).
3. *Yoga Sutras of Patanjali*: Mention multiple universes (bhuvanas) within the cosmic consciousness.

*Key Concepts:*

1. *Brahmanda*: The cosmic egg, containing multiple universes.
2. *Lokas*: Multiple worlds or realms within the universe.
3. *Bhuvanas*: Multiple universes within the cosmos.
4. *Jagats*: Multiple universes within the ultimate reality.

*Hindu Cosmological Models:*

1. *The Egg of Brahma*: A cosmic egg containing multiple universes.
2. *The Lotus Universe*: A universe arising from the lotus flower of the ultimate reality.
3. *The Wheel of Time*: A cyclical model of creation and destruction.

*Modern Interpretations:*

1. *Many-Worlds Interpretation*: Inspired by Hindu concepts, this theory proposes multiple parallel universes.
2. *Inflationary Multiverse*: Hindu texts' descriptions of multiple universes align with modern inflationary theories.

*Influential Hindu Thinkers:*

1. *Adi Shankara*: Expounded on the concept of multiple universes within Advaita Vedanta.
2. *Ramanuja*: Developed the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta philosophy, incorporating multiple universes.
3. *Aurobindo Ghose*: Integrated Hindu concepts with modern scientific thought.

While Hindu texts don't provide a direct, scientific hypothesis for the multiverse, they offer a rich philosophical and cosmological framework that resonates with modern theories.

And so on.       
       
         
(and please women practitioners also give their guidance. i need guidance from all people, females, males and everyone . and from a Aatma perspective too, where one is beyond gender or distinctions). 
      
        
For example, i want to know why bad people (people who do bad karma or paap) are getting away with things and getting their desires seemingly fulfilled, yet those who want to walk on Dharma and good karma it seems hard for them to do so, and sometimes it even gives them failure while being bad could actually give them success.      
     
       
I will give u a very real-life instance. As you know, if you work and are dishonest, trying to get 2nd-number income (black money or bribe money, or stealing noney from budgets) then you become easily rich, even can enjoy your life. And you can still use this money to worship God and voila here now you also have favour of Gods. Also if you are someone who cusses or swear-words (gaali dene wala vyakti, in hindi) then you also get friends and people get scare from you/don't interfere with you because u cuss.        
       
       
but people who do not cuss, because they know how bad and impure it is, they sometimes are seen as fools or weak. (agar koi tumko gaali deta hai, aur tum unko gaali nahi dete ho kyuki gaali dena ekdam gandi chij hai. lekin tum khud hi bewakoof or should i say ch#/tiya dikhte ho. phir se ek gandi chij yani gaali ne achhai ko haraa diya).        
         
           
And when u want to uplift yourself spiritually, then u cannot find a genuine real Guru or even a advance person. ""Kaliyug naam adhaaraa"" won't actually give you moksha, all the name chanting can do is purifying you for actual spiritual journey.       
       
         
1 – so how do i follow Dharma, and worship of my Ishta ParaBrahman Devataa (mine is Shiva, and i also have great inclination to Parvati and Vishnu) so i can uplift spirituall?       
        
         
2– and i am not doing this ""haa got u"", ""right in your face"" thingy. Whatever Vedas or Puraanas says, we just need the right paath. this ""got you"" moments will not advance us spiritually, this is why i think reading in Geeta that Krishna says a person should again and again read Upanishads of Vedas. because Upanishads actually give you the knowledge or connection to ParaBrahman.       
       
         
3– i sometimes come in situation where it feels doing Adharma is my only choice. For example i told u about Gaali (cuss words). i often see some wretched bad male boys and men troubling people and catcalling and cussing at people (and sadly a few bad girls joining them too). There is no other way to call them out, other than cussing back at them with such bad cuss-words like ""bhe#/hod"", ""maa k#/hut"", ""mad#/hod"", ""ch#/tiya"", and such. the bad words ""sa#/la"" , ""ka#/eena"", ""kut#/a"" is just so normal for them, in fact they use these words freely and feel powerful about it. And see a person not using these words as weaks.   Some of my elders and brothers cuss back at them, only then they stop cussing and using such bad inappropriate language.        
       
         
4– this makes me wonder. where is God sitting in all this? why does cussing gives them power, and the only way to stop them is cussing back at them. making yourself impure with bad words coming from your mouth. What has happened, and if this is the state, how will people walk in path of spirituality?        
        
        
5– there are Rishi Munis present even now in Kaliyuga on earth. Yogi Yoginis are definitely here, but why don't they destroy these bad people? and come to protect and uplift the good people who walk on Dharma and spiritual path.         
      
       
6. what to even do? we cannot keep dismissing things with ""uh bad karma"" , ""uh god is testing u"", ""uh god is cleansing ur paap karma"" . This is completely senseless. God can also come to fix and destroy the bad people, then automatically everyone can walk on path of Dharma. in Kaliyug, it seems everything which is against God and Dharma is getting full support, while those who speak of God and Dharma get bashed. Just see how Hinduism, the very core Dharma is most bashed . why the (irr-)religions of violence and bad karma are being protected as ""minorities"" . People today even hindus are trying to argue that ""cow is not that important"" ?!! Cow is verily a most important animal or being, all Gods reside verily in cow. Yes, you must not go in super superstition-mode , but saying cow is not important. Well the reason is, you today have become weak to protect cows , so to cover up your guilt are resorting to excuses that ""cows are not that important"" .          
        
         
7– so much more i can keep saying, the list will go on so long. But u get the gist of what i am asking. So how does one even follow Dharma and spirituality. And i again say, said it many times, but saying again, that i am not asking for any ""haa got you"", ""haa in your face"", ""here accept it, got u"" moments.

EDIT: i removed an ""example"" that i originally wrote in last paragraph, because some people were sticking to that 1-example alone, instead of talking about the whole post. The post simply asks for ""advice on how to walk on path of Dharma and spirituality"" and some people instead of answering this, they were discussing about just 1-last paragraph that too which was used as an ""example"". see, now i removed the last paragraph, the gist of post still remains the same, because the post was not about 1-last paragraph , it is about ""Advice on how to walk in path of dharma and spiritual connection to ParaBrahman"".

How this societal hierarchy of class system was invented and widely used by Vishnu followers. How one can easily criticise sivan while he can’t say a word bad on Vishnu.

He went on to explain this as how this difference is influenced in modern day politics by comparing how South Indians are more sivan followers while north is more of Vishnu following. 

I am not that much of expert and I don’t want to create a debate. I just want someone with clear knowledge on this topic explain me how much truth does his statement hold?

1. Are agamas shruti? Because their authority relies on themselves right? I've not seen any other sacred scripture refer to them as shruti, but the itihasas, puranas, and gita mentions the authority of the vedas so isn't it more of like a sect thing to raise it to the level of shruti?

2. If the aghori derive their practices from these agamas which involve human meat consumption, alcohol meat etc., not only the aghori actually, isn't all of vamachara tantra going against vedic teachings such as to not consume human meat, etc.? How can we reconcile the fact that there are two shrutis with contradicting practices?

I could really use an outside perspective on a tough situation with my dad. My family is South Indian, and we have a deep-rooted belief in astrology. I respect that—it’s part of our culture, and I even find some patterns interesting since it overlaps with certain aspects of science. However, I also believe that astrology can’t predict or explain every challenge in life.

Recently, a few conversations with my dad left me feeling frustrated. It started when he mentioned that some couples face difficulties having children because their horoscopes weren't checked properly before marriage. I felt uncomfortable with this, but I stayed quiet to keep the peace.

Then, it came up again when my mom and I were talking about a family friend whose son has autism. My dad jumped in, saying that this happened because the parents had a love marriage and didn’t consult their horoscopes. That was the moment I couldn’t stay quiet. I tried to express that not every challenge or “drawback” can be attributed to astrology, and even if they had followed it, it wouldn’t guarantee a “perfect” or “smooth-sailing” life.

Unfortunately, my dad interrupted, got extremely upset, and started yelling, saying things like, “I put so much effort into your horoscope, and you don’t even believe in it.” He called me rude and ungrateful, said my generation is disrespectful and overly educated, and didn’t let me finish my thoughts. It was really disheartening because I wasn’t trying to dismiss his beliefs—I just wanted to share that I don’t see astrology as the ultimate explanation for every life event.

I know he cares and genuinely wants the best for me, and I appreciate that. But I also feel that life’s challenges are influenced by many factors beyond astrology. Has anyone else dealt with a similar clash of beliefs with family?

I wanted to share and collect feedback for a project some of us are working on to make the Gita more accessible. We made [https://gitavachan.com](https://gitavachan.com/) where you can ask the Gita for a query in your own words and the most relevant verse so that you can then go read more and explore the knowledge.

For example, let's say you are dealing with some family issues, then you can ask ""What does the Gita say about family?"" or if you want to know what the Gita says about the earth: ""what does it say about the earth?"" and it helps you navigate which chapters might have the most relevant information for example:

\`\`\`  
The Bhagavad Gita provides a deep philosophical perspective on the nature of the Earth, emphasizing its role in the creation and sustenance of life. The following verses encapsulate its significance:

1. **Chapter 7, Verse 9:** ""I am the pure fragrance of the Earth, and the brilliance in fire. I am the life-force in all beings, and the penance of the ascetics."" This verse highlights Lord Krishna as the essence within the Earth and other elements, signifying that He is the vital force behind all existence.
2. **Chapter 15, Verse 13:** ""Permeating the earth, I nourish all living beings with My energy. Becoming the moon, I nourish all plants with the juice of life."" Here, Krishna explains how He sustains life on Earth through His divine energy, indicating that all physical conditions suitable for life stem from Him.
3. **Chapter 15, Verse 14:** ""It is I who take the form of the fire of digestion in the stomachs of all living beings, and combine with the incoming and outgoing breaths, to digest and assimilate the four kinds of foods."" This verse indicates that the process of digestion and nourishment on Earth is also a manifestation of the divine.
4. **Chapter 7, Verse 4:** ""Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect, and ego—these are eight components of My material energy."" This verse elaborates on the material composition of the Earth, indicating that all elements are manifestations of God's energy.

Each day of this festival resonates with a unique story, deeply embedded in Hindu mythology, that reminds us of resilience, devotion, and renewal.

**Dhanteras** (Dhantrayodashi) marks the arrival of Lord Dhanvantari from the cosmic churning, *Samudra Manthan*. Emerging with a pot of the sacred nectar of immortality, along with scriptures and medicinal herbs, he symbolizes health, wellness, and divine healing. On this day, we honor the divine gifts of health and prosperity, setting the tone for the blessings that the Diwali festival brings.

On **Narak Chaturdashi**, we recall the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura. With great courage, Krishna liberated 16,000 captives, offering them a life of dignity and freedom. This tale teaches us that even in the darkest times, justice and compassion can prevail, freeing us from the shackles of our fears.

**Lakshmi Pujan**, synonymous with Diwali, celebrates the birth of Goddess Lakshmi during the *Samudra Manthan*. In her divine choice, she marries Lord Vishnu, representing the union of abundance and preservation. This day also commemorates Lord Rama’s triumphant return to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, where he defeated the evil Ravana and rescued his beloved Sita. As Ayodhya lit up in joyous welcome, so do our homes, inviting prosperity, love, and harmony.

**Balipratipada** or **Padwa** honors Lord Vishnu’s victory over King Bali. By subduing Bali and sending him to the netherworld (Naraka), Vishnu restored balance and order in the universe. It’s also the day Lord Krishna lifted the Govardhan mountain, sheltering villagers from the wrath of Indra’s torrential rains. These stories remind us of divine intervention in times of crisis and the protective grace that shields us in the storms of life.

On **Bhau-Beej**, we celebrate the sacred bond between brothers and sisters. This day is marked by Lord Krishna’s visit to his sister Subhadra after his victory over Narakasura. Welcomed with warmth and affection, this tradition strengthens the ties of family, a reminder that our loved ones are a source of support and comfort in both victories and challenges.

Diwali aligns with **Amavasya**, a time symbolizing light’s triumph over darkness and good’s victory over evil. Just as the moon moves from darkness to light, so too does this new moon encourage us to let go of past negativities, embrace renewal, and foster spiritual growth. Amavasya holds special importance in yoga and spirituality, representing an ideal time for cleansing, introspection, and inward reflection.

As we light our lamps this Diwali, let’s embrace the peace, clarity, and renewal that Amavasya offers. Let it be a time to pause, reflect, and release what no longer serves us, ushering in new beginnings filled with inner harmony and profound spiritual growth. May this festival of lights illuminate your journey toward wisdom and joy. Just as the Devas and Asuras focused their energies in the cosmic churning of Samudra Manthan, may you too find the strength to navigate life’s challenges and discover the nectar of true happiness and well-being.

Wishing everyone a Diwali filled with divine blessings, inner peace, and radiant joy!",1,True,Hindū Festival,festival,1.0,False,Hindū Festival

What I understood from that is Your Karma may be directed twds your Fala , but it doesn't ensure its attainment.  

The issue I have in this statement is that this philosophy doesn't account for Dharma in to the picture as to may of the times it may be in the conflict with Karma you may need to do for attaining the Fala.

For ex : In recent times we have seen may job aspirants and students using AI for job related process , sepecififcally designed to test their competency ; in such a case your karma are not Dharmic in nature, but if you don't do them you are essentially losing out on job markets because on avg you would be worswe in your presentation. Hence in the gioal of attaining FALA. There is an inherent competetion between the Dharmic Way and Dharma.

I am not very practicing person and more aligned with karma and jnan yoga so I am not aware of the cow urine and dung uses. He asked me why do Hindus have such obsession with cows to drink urine and eat poop. Showed me a video of some South Indian Hindu women eating poop kept on temple stair as a religious tradition in some village and a festival in North India where people cover themselves in poop. Why such indeceny? Is it really what is preached as true? My very religious parents never made me do it?   
We all know our faith has unnecessary stereotype that cow dung and urine is consumed as pure and holy. But as a hindu from birth, I have never consumed it . In my village cow dung was used for manure and uple ( dried cow dung cakes ) for fuels. The urine at times was used in some puja, as sealant for old houses made of mud. But I have never read anywhere in major scriptures that we need to necessarily use cow dung or urine to purify ourselves with it. I also know krishna the one closest to cows never did it and neither did any major Rishi or saint . So why and where did this myth come from?

Some communities have this tradition of bathing in cow poop as well in North India. While I understand practices and how cows have been a central livelihood of hindu life, this seems too much. Are there really any major books stating us to do it or is it just a fringe idea that gained momentum.

One person told me during mahamari or epidemic people started using urine and dung to treat people cuz it might help in past as they weren't very aware of medicine. Thus it became a part of ayurveda and practice. What is true. This story seems reasonable but do we really need to continue such practices? Can't we educate ourselves atleast in proper sense to not obsess with cows in such ways that don't have any basis or is there any basis?",38,True,Question - Beginner,,0.56,False,Question - Beginner

Also I think the Puranas are very biased to the sampradaya they belong to - the Shiva Purana will obviously put Shiva on top, while the Vishnu Purana will put Vishnu on top, and so on.

Brahma is a very weird figure - on one hand, he (metaphorically) doesn't hold any weapons, he only holds ""pure"" things - the lotus, the vedas, a kamandalu, a mala. His 4 faces sing the four Vedas, and he is of golden color. One should meditate on him if one wants to awaken the Muladhara chakra.

On the other hands, there's the puranas. There Brahma is a liar, a rap\*ist and so one. he's obviously not a good figure.

I'm having a hard time ""cracking"" Brahma and connecting to him where all of those puranic myths depict him as bad. It's also very confusing because Brahma is basically Prajapati, which is very appreciated and hailed in the vedas.

I'm looking to hear your points of view regarding Brahma and how to reconcile Puranic view of Brahma to the pure deity that the vedas teach. Is Brahma ""good"" or bad? Is Brahma pure or he is the Maya personified?

I have being doing my laxmi sadhna since 4 days. There was ingredients such as rice,sugar  etc on there. And for 4 days there were no insects. Yet today I found a whole infestation of red ants amidst the rice.

So my question is, is it inauspiscious? Is my sidhi broken? 
I suspect 2 reasons for this happening(2 things I may have done wrong in yesterday's sitting) but I want to know what is generally believed about these kinds of situations.

I've been trying to shoo them, cuz google said red ants are not good but at the same time I wonder if they are a rupam of the devi so, what am I supposed to do?",3,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

It's not just our family but a lot of Hindu people I know will eat literally *everything* but beef. The reasons I hear from people as to why they don't eat beef sound contradictory to me. I am told to not eat beef since cows are sacred in Hinduism. But does the Bhagavad Gita not say that all living beings are equal in essence?

I would like to go vegetarian, but truthfully, really want a try a good steak just once in my life. So maybe I'm just making excuses to myself. But does it not sort of contradict what Hinduism says to refrain *only* from cows? Or is this refraining from eating cows more of a cultural thing than anything? 

I know that ISKCON play a huge role in bringing Hinduism to western society. But I guess to a lot of westerners it'd be pretty hard to give up meat all of a sudden, so there was the more friendly option of only giving up beef?

A lot of my ""Hindu"" friends also don't really know *anything* about their religion. So I was thinking perhaps it's a way for the less religious Hindus to hold on to it. As in ""Hey, I MIGHT not exactly-totally interact with my religion, but I'm still Hindu because I don't eat beef.""

If you are someone who eats everything but beef, why? I don't mean any hate- I am just curious of the reasons because I feel as if it's just contradictory to Bhagavad Gita's teachings.

I come from a Marwadi Hindu family where I have heard of this thing called “Aanth” , if someone from the family dies on that festival day (I have heard that most Marwadi are aware of this, not sure about others. Apologies for ignorance). For example - my grandfather passed during Chaitra Navratri and we haven’t celebrated those days of Navratri since 3 years. The pandit who did all rites for 12 days that the Aanth can only be removed if a child is born in the family during that Navratri. I wanted to understand what everyone else does and if there is any scripture reference to this. What if a child is not born for generations together? Won’t this result in the festival losing its way of celebration and its culture for that family in a few generations? What are your thoughts?

But never was much of a pooja person. Though i loved reading about our culture 

Then I came across people like rajarshi nandy and parveen ramakrishna, the tantra upasaks, Their books and podcast and videos along with om swami and his books

I started upasna with 51 mala of bhairava Naam mantra on ashtami upasana through rajarshi Nandy telegram group, I liked the principle way how satvic tantra upasana and i think this is the path i want to follow 

But i am confused, I am not sure who me ishta dev/devi is i dont really have much favouritism, I always liked rajas devta mostly, I also like vishnu, the lord narayan, but vishnu is not recommended to be worshiped in tantra, their is separate ways for him and also he is one of the great God os us, so attaining him takes lifetimes

Thorugh various sources I found that Bhairav is most fast to response to upasaks, I crave even the minute sort of experiences and people describe them in podcast and books, but then I found that if you don't have a ishta you should start with ganesha, I did around a month of basic name mantra of ganesha to guide me, since I don't have a guru and i dont plan on waiting for one, God will send one when I am ready, meanwhile in navratri i also did 32 names of durga sadhna, as among devi she and lakshmi are me fav

Then I came across parveen video where he explained how bhariva is forgiving and has a guru tattva, if you don't have a guru he is your best bet as he responds very fast and is the great guru himself, and I started with bhariva upasna with occasional special upasnas, then in one video he explained how dogs are important in bhariva sadhna and if someone is afraid of dog, this might be sign that bhariva is not the right deity for you, my grandmother died because of dog bite and I myself fear street dog, I don't hate them, but have a habit of maintaning distance for just is case, though I don't really hate dogs, but I much like cats

I commented on his video if I should try devi upasana since I like cats, he said devi won't come without bhairav and i would be better off with ganesha. But for some reason I have this doubt like everybody says bhariva responds fastest, and ganesha is his son, shouldn't worshiping bhariva best choice. This type doubt create miss trust in mantra and i know that one of the worse things. I also like the principal of Sri vidya and learned a bit about the, I am mostly comfortable with all deities other then the one which should be just called upon regularly like shamshan deities 

I am just confused which deity I should go ahead with, I like the satvic tantrik path for now, grew up in a vashinav household, have a bit liking to vishnu, but don't really resonate with things like iskon and others, liking towards rajas gods like durga. I don't really have ishta dev/devi and i would like to find them, I want to have experience of the deity, I know it takes years for that, but getting experiences with vishnu or shiva might just well take life times, I just want to know which deity I should start sadhna of who is like fast to give responses, so that I can fully dedicate even though it might take years but if I know he/she will come I know I can keep going, I want to have sense of trust in mantra, and if someone can help me figure out my ishta, as they are supposed to be fastest to you I would be gratefull

Please help, I will provide any other information you might need to help me
Also please if you are recommending something, like eg worship ganesha please also specify thing like which one like Mahaganapati Uchista ganpati and if comfortable recommended mantra or a link to it

1gdkbm7,A question about life karma and bad luck,Specialist-Shine8927,2024-10-27 20:23:32+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gdkbm7/a_question_about_life_karma_and_bad_luck/,10,/r/hinduism/comments/1gdkbm7/a_question_about_life_karma_and_bad_luck/,hinduism,"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit; if it isn’t, could you please point me to the right one?

I've noticed something about how karma seems to affect me. Whenever I do or say something that hurts someone—intentionally or unintentionally—it feels like karma hits me back almost immediately, whether it’s the same day, a few days later, or maybe even weeks later, but always pretty fast. I’m a big believer in karma, but I wonder, why me?

Why does karma seem to target me so quickly but not the people who are actually mean or harmful? I know people who hurt others consistently, but they don’t seem to get any immediate consequences. For me, karma strikes hard, even if I feel remorse or realize afterward that I acted without thinking. This has led me to question if it’s really karma or maybe just bad luck—or maybe a mix of both, which would feel even worse.

If it’s bad luck, I’m curious how it actually differs from karma. Without getting too deep into my personal life, I’m pretty certain that life is against me most times—like I was never meant to be born. I definitely feel like I have bad luck, like if if I feel excited or happy or ready, it’s usually short-lived because something happens, or something embarrassing will happen to ruin it.

It also reminds me of the idea that “the kind or sensitive often suffer more than the strong or ruthless.” It feels like people who are more empathetic or emotional tend to be affected by karma /bad luck faster or more intensely, while people who are more detached or intentionally hurtful don’t seem to face consequences at all. Also if someone does abd to me or hurts my feelings nothing happens to them

Any thoughts on why this might be? Or how to tell if it’s karma or just bad luck?

I work as a software engineer and the first 3 years of my career I worked in a company, it was very good and everyone praised me but then I decided to move on, I was full of confidence when I switched, in my second company I was put in a very complicated project, I take stress easily when I don't understand something, I lose my appetite in stress, so even after spending 9 months it didn't get better, only more complex and my mental health got worse, I completed 1 year there and moved on, the guy who got my work also resigned after 4 months, that's how complex it was.

 The third job was a small Indian service company where first 5 months were okay-ish but then I was put in big old project where the management was very bad, the deadlines and micromanagement were crazy, we were forced to do work in as less time as possible to impress client, the company was very desperate for this client. I resigned after 3 hard months and completed 1 year there too. 2 week after I left, I found out they fired 2 members from my team of 4, so I got out in good.

Now I'm unemployed and very scared with these 2 bad experience, I'm scared what will happen in the next company, what if it is also bad with bad management and toxic culture.
I know worrying about future is pointless and it's mostly luck but with these 2 experiences it's very hard to calm down. I'm lucky my family is supportive.

With recent allegations circulating about Isha, I felt compelled to share my own experiences.

I did my inner engineering in 2023 February and got initiated the same month. And, ever since I have been practising Shambhavi Mahamudra, (ngl i do miss my practise sometimes but i try my best to stay consistent with it) and the kind of tranquility I feel within myself is indescribable. 

Now, let me address the rumours regarding the ashram. I have been to the ashram, stayed there for a couple of nights...and when I say it is a slice of heaven...trust me, I am not over exaggerating it. There is no compulsion to take sanyasi, there is no compulsion to do ANYTHING!

Every year, many intellectuals provide ""insight"" on Hindu festivals: Holi supposedly wastes water, Diwali increases air pollution, Makar Sankranti’s kite strings harm innocent birds, Pongal's Jallikattu shows cruelty towards animals, Ganesh and Durga idol immersions pollute water, and Garba causes noise pollution. All objections are centered on Hindu practices.

Meanwhile, globally celebrated events face no such scrutiny. On Bakrid, animals are loved, as in Spain's bullfighting, China’s Yulin Dog Meat Festival, South Korea's Boryeong Mud Festival, Spain’s La Tomatina, Thailand's Songkran, and Italy's Battle of the Oranges, which apparently have no adverse impact on the environment. Somehow, environmental damage and global warming are always attributed to Hindu customs.

Despite this, we Hindus mostly abide by Supreme Court and government orders. We know that the government often deflects its own failures onto the public. For 364 days, there’s no environmental concern, but on one day of Diwali, pollution suddenly becomes a major issue, with claims that world civilization is in jeopardy. The U.S. has been waging wars worldwide for years without facing scrutiny for pollution, but if we celebrate one day of Diwali, the world supposedly inches toward destruction.

So, I ask—will you burst firecrackers this Diwali?

I recently joined this sub, and while scrolling through, I noticed so many young people eager to walk the path of Dharma. It’s truly heartwarming to see the variety of questions, answers, and advice from all perspectives.

But there’s one thing I want to point out: some of us are getting caught up in really complex questions that might not be as important as actually practicing Sadhana. I don’t mean to sound dismissive, but sometimes we can get too focused on details that don’t matter until we start doing the real work. It’s like wanting to know everything about gyms, trainers, how muscles grow, and diet plans without actually hitting the gym.

Also, a quick heads-up: be mindful of spending too much time on certain podcasts like BeerBiceps. He covers a lot of religious and spiritual topics, but you’ll rarely hear him ask his guests to break down a simple sadhana or meditation technique. He’s got his own app for that, so it feels like he’s subtly promoting it.

All I’m saying is, keep up with your journey into Dharma, but don’t get lost in unnecessary books, endless questions, or podcasts that only scratch the surface. Spend more time meditating, doing simple sadhanas dedicated to your favorite deity, and chant with devotion. Trust that the answers are within you.

Also hoping to get advice from those most knowledgeable about this vs speculation/assumption, though all are still welcome. 

I’ve had murthies in my home over the course of the last 10 years. I got them at various points in the last 10 years as I wanted to start praying and just being more religious, having someone to talk to when I’m down and truly struggling. However, I have not prayed daily in years now, and over time, there are long gaps in doing anything religious (no lighting diya, no incense, no prayers/slokams). I am someone who believes these things are not as important as just being a good person in life. I feel doing all these ritualistic things are just more of bribing God for things, and when I do pray, I NEVER ask for anything for myself. I pray that I’m thankful for what I’ve been given and ask that God help those who are truly suffering, that’s it. I also do not like that there are certain times of day rituals/prayers can only happen so a lot of my not doing them is as a result of missing the timing and feeling that something (bad) may happen by doing religious things outside of the specific times.

With all that said, I’ve had a lot of bad luck in the way of trying to find a partner and more and more feeling utterly low in life and hating life. I’m wondering if my inability (and truthfully, laziness and stubbornness) to do prayers/puja daily and at the time they are expected to be done is causing this black cloud in my life. 

I’ve recently been contemplating asking the temple priest about how to donate my murthies in case this is what is affecting my life negatively. Not to say God has ill wishes towards me but that if the expectation of the religion/practice is to worship the murthies in a certain way, there could be negative consequences for not doing so.

Anyways any help or thoughts on this is greatly appreciated. ",12,True,Question - General,,0.54,False,Question - General

Hello folks, I'm an Indonesian Hindu that is currently researching about the Chandala, known likewise as untouchable or dalits. Primarily my research deals with the outcastes of the Majapahit Empire (14th Indonesian Shaivism-Buddhism Empire), but since informations regarding the Chandalas in that specific society is scarce, and since this system were brought in from India, I supposed learning directly from the source would be a suitable alternative. 

Now, my questions are twofold. First, what are the rules that a Chandala has to adhere? If you know any, please list them, even if they're specifics to your city or province.

Second, can you give me some scriptural reason why one is cursed to be a Chandal? It could be your own understanding or an exact verse. My understanding is rather shallow, but I supposed, as with other births, it pertains to one's karma from the previous life? 

I'm currently reading Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's undelivered speech ""Annihilation of Caste,"" which, of course, spoke against it, against any sort of caste system, even. If you have any books or article to educate me, please do share!

I am thinking about converting to Hinduism. I initially thought I would like Jainism, because I have been vegan for years. But I'm learning there's actually a lot of vegan Hindus so I feel better about it. I feel a strong connection to Kali and Krishna but I just feel like I can't get anywhere.

Is this common? I've only been studying for a few weeks. But god, I'm just not getting it. I feel like I'm too dumb for Hinduism :(

I'm thinking maybe reading children's books and maybe watching some kids shows (I love Little Krishna lol) but I feel like that wouldn't give me a real understanding.

I do want to go to a temple but I can't afford the proper clothes yet (I'm a woman) so I'm putting it off. I'm also really nervous because I'm not Indian, I have a lip/nose piercing and stretched earlobes, bright red dyed hair with some dreadlocks. I'd stick out severely and I've heard sometimes there are gossipy women who are kinda mean. I've also experienced this in my childhood Catholic church and it was awful.

No godmen is above God, Lord Krishna or by any name you call the almighty... The fact it is a real case also amazes me, and I am sure this is also true in present day to some extent. 

Surely, Gurus and Saints are important part of serving Dharma, but one should not follow them blindly as afterall they are human too with senses, they are not perfect like God... Guru should be respected and taken blessings from, but not  blindly worshiped.

Here it is:

>Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.

.

>तं होवाच नैतदब्राह्मणो विवक्तुमर्हति समिधं सोम्याहरोप त्वा नेष्ये न सत्यादगा इति तमुपनीय कृशानामबलानां चतुःशता गा निराकृत्योवाचेमाः सोम्यानुसंव्रजेति ता अभिप्रस्थापयन्नुवाच नासहस्रेणावर्तेयेति स ह वर्षगणं प्रोवास ता यदा सहस्रं सम्पेदुः ॥ ४.४.५ ॥

Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. \[Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.\] O Somya, go and get me some fuel \[for the sacrificial fire\]. I will initiate you \[as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread\], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away \[and look after them\].’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

**My question: Doesn't it simply imply that Satyakāma's actual biological father is a Brāhmin? It did not say ""anyone"" who is this truthful is a Brāhmin.**

**This is exactly how Paraśurāma found out that Karna was a Kshatriya in Mahābhārata. An insect bit through Karna's lap whilst Paraśurāma was asleep on his lap but he did not flinch. Lord Paraśurāma on seeing this said:**

>How could a brahmana bear so much pain? Only a kshatriya could have done so.

I started reading about the kuru dynasty kings. Consider the 2 children of Satyavati and Santanu. Chitrangada died due to fighting with a Gandhara with the same name. He in my knowledge did not do anything bad, didn't have any bad karma. Why did he lose that fight and die? 

Secondly consider the case of Vichitravirya. He got married and was filled with lust and died after spending 7 years with his wife of tuberculosis. He neglected his duties as a king, but did he really do anything bad in his life to die? 

Consider the case of Bhishma. He did do se eral wrong things in his life like not defending Draupadi and participating in the wrong side of the war. But when he asked Krisha why he was suffering so much on his bed of arrows, he was shown what he did on his past life and what he did to that chameleon or snake in one of his past life. 

Now, some of the sources are probably not from Vyasa Mahabharata. I was reading them from the internet. So plz tell me from Vyasa Mahabharata why didn't karma work for them? 

Edit: I also want to know what draupadi did to almost get disrobed and humiliated like that? I mean in some versions she mocked Duryodhana but in the original Vyasa Mahabharata I think she was totally innocent. 

Edit 2: What did Abhimanyu do to die like that?

I discussed this with my father and one morning I asked him to talk to our family astrologer, who said Rahu and Shani are heavy in my chart for a while and it will be like this till next year. 

From childhood, I never really felt any strong connection to any particular god, I would worship whoever my parents would do pujas for (Shiv ji, Laxmi Ma, Hanuman ji and Durga Ma). When I was 16 I started reading about Saraswati Ma and felt very connected. I always thought she'd bless me with knowledge and creative talent, however despite trying very hard, I haven't been successful in whatever I do. 

I feel like whatever I do, God isn't letting it happen. I am not blaming God or anyone, just to be clear. For a while I thought all of my gods who I worshipped hated me, but then I realised more than hatred they are indifferent to my existence, which hurt even more. That no matter how much I thank them, think of them, they probably will never hear my cries or pleas or prayers.

*Yudhishthira said, 'Who are those persons, O Bharata, from whom a Brahmana in this world may accept his food? From whom may a Kshatriya, a Vaisya, and a Sudra take their food respectively?'*

\*Bhishma said, '\****A Brahmana may take his food from another Brahmana or from a Kshatriya or a Vaisya, but he must never accept food from a Sudra. A Kshatriya may take his food from a Brahmana, a Kshatriya or a Vaisya.*** *He must, however,* ***eschew food given by Sudras who are addicted to evil ways and who partake of all manner of food without any scruple. Brahmanas and Kshatriyas can partake of food given by such Vaisyas as tend the sacred fire every day, as are faultless in character, and as perform the vow of Chaturmasya.***

***But the man who takes food from a Sudra, swallows the very abomination of the earth, and drinks the excretions of the human body, and partakes of the filth of all the world.*** *He partakes of the very filth of the earth who takes his food thus from a Sudra.* ***Verily, those Brahmanas that take their food from Sudras, take the dirt of the earth. If one engages in the service of a Sudra, one is doomed to perdition though one may duly perform all the rites of one's order.*** *A Brahmana, a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, so engaging, is doomed, although devoted to the due performance of religious rites. It is said that a Brahmana's duty consists in studying the Vedas and seeking the welfare of the human race; that a Kshatriya's duty consists in protecting men, and that a Vaisya's in promoting their material prosperity.*

*A Vaisya lives by distributing the fruits of his own acts and agriculture. The breeding of kine and trade are the legitimate work in which a Vaisya may engage without fear of censure. The man who abandons his own proper occupation and betakes himself to that of a Sudra, should be considered as a Sudra and on no account should any food be accepted from him.* ***Professors of the healing art, mercenary soldiers, the priest who acts as warder of the house, and persons who devote a whole year to study without any profit, are all to be considered as Sudras***\*. And those who impudently partake of food offered at ceremonials in a Sudra's house are afflicted with a terrible calamity.\*

*In consequence of partaking such forbidden food they lose their family, strength, and energy, and attain to the status of animals, descending to the position of dogs, fallen in virtue and devoid of all religious observances.* ***He who takes food from a physician takes that which is no better than excrement; the food of a harlot is like urine; that of a skilled mechanic is like blood.*** ***If a Brahmana approved by the good, takes the food of one who lives by his learning, he is regarded as taking the food of a Sudra.*** *All good men should forego such food. The food of a person who is censured by all is said to be like a draught from a pool of blood.* ***The acceptance of food from a wicked person is considered as reprehensible as the slaying of a Brahmana***\*.\*

*One should not accept food if one is slighted and not received with due honours by the giver. A Brahmana, who does so, is soon overtaken by disease, and his race soon becomes extinct. By accepting food from the warder of a city, one descends to the status of the lowest outcaste.* ***If a Brahmana accepts food from one who is guilty of killing either a cow or a Brahmana or from one who has committed adultery with his preceptor's wife or from a drunkard, he helps to promote the race of Rakshasas.*** *By accepting food from a eunuch, or from an ungrateful person, or from one who has misappropriated wealth entrusted to his charge, one is born in the country of the Savaras situated beyond the precincts of the middle country.*

*I have thus duly recited to thee the persons from whom food may be accepted and from whom it may not. Now tell me, O son of Kunti, what else thou wish*est to hear from me today.'

I am not asking for a „scientific” Jung related explanation, just a genuine thought about this from people, who are Hinduists for a little longer.

So, I had this colleague who is a believer, she follows a certain Guru. She actually was the one who brought me on this path as I am a person who is genuinely very curious. She has gifted me a Bhagavad Gita. But this is just the beginning.

As the time passes, I have found myself writing a MA thesis about Hinduism and its relationship to philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. I have watched online darshans with said guru, listened to mantra sang by him, almost on daily basis I was learning new things. 

Now, a month later, when I stopped watching or thinking about this guru and even did not look into any books nor listened to mantra (but I still occasionally chant it), I had a dream, where the Guru has given me a blessing. What is weird to me is that this did not happen when I was in the “you’re thinking about it way too much” era - I did not have these dreams during the intense studies, nor when I got firstly interested in Hinduism. 

Is this a way of being blessed? 

To explain why am I doing a little less now - I am still trying to find my path in this world. I also have been through very bad times made by people faithful to the Christian god, which is making me question my own beliefs even more.

Be it men or women. I have a suspicious lack of true friends in my life. All I have got is my childhood friends, and even they continuously elude me. Not involving me in their plans, not missing me when I am absent, perhaps even talking behind my back. 

During this past Navratri, I realised how they weren't my true friends. A bunch of girls showed up with them for Garba, and they wouldn't pay me any mind. I was kind of going through a rough patch in life at that time (still am), and they didn't even ask me if I was okay. I cried myself to sleep through a few days. And I rarely cry.  

Every attempt I have engaged in to find new friends, I have found that they never prioritise me over the other trivial things going on in their lives. The biggest point of contention for me is women. All my friends that have known me since long, and who I have financially sacrificed a lot for have effortlessly left me behind for pretty girls. That really pisses me off. Somedays I feel like spending some time with those friends, only to find out that they are spending time with some random women out there. The occasional time that they do spend with me is spent talking about things that do not interest me. I eventually leave the meetings, with them paying my departure no mind.

This has been going on for years, and now I am convinced that a higher power is at play, continuously bringing me pain and loneliness. I had quit smoking a few months back, but I have picked it up again and it's even more intense than before. 

I have tried to get into dating as well to try and find that someone special who I could talk to and always rely on, only to have that fall flat on my face just as well.

The thing is, I feel like I don't deserve this loneliness and pain. Has anyone else experienced this after becoming spiritual? What could Lord Krishna be thinking?

1gbyxic,So agnostic or hindu,Upbeat-Scientist-931,2024-10-25 17:51:44+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gbyxic/so_agnostic_or_hindu/,3,/r/hinduism/comments/1gbyxic/so_agnostic_or_hindu/,hinduism,"Simple sa question hai mujhe. I am proper  Hindu. But the more I delve in the religion, I realise I am more aligned with the philosophy of God, existence, good and bad rather than everything scriptural word by word. I wanna learn and know about everything but I am not interested in following everything. Aisa toh hai nahi ki har scriptures vedo ki tarah important ya literal hai. Most of our scriptures are literary and more ethic morality based stories rather than actual happening. While I believe Lord Ram and krishna existed, I don't take the whole story to be very literal and consider the supernatural part as way of literary caricature of happening. Uske upar yk like sabke traditions and cultures in our religion are different due to different origin and understanding of the world and faith but still hold very much common grounds. Hamara religion never had a prophet but several pre Vedic societies brought under same discipline of Sanatana. Humare scriptures in different societies are also practiced differently but somehow everyone seems to act as if being a religious super traditional northern vegetarian Hindu is the only right way. Most of our scriptures are mostly northern so I get it why the influence but is being not very traditional, scriptural really wrong? Like har puran and mythology story thodi na real hogi? Most of purans like shaivism and vaishnavism ka ek dushre ko lekar perception alag alag hai. It's clear that they had personal bias, so why do people act like every thing is God sent and not realise ki most of it is our own human work of literary scholarship. Uske upar the people obsession with manusmriti and jaati system is really disturbing for me. I get why Varna system came to be but jaati is stupid stupid but people defend jaati pratha as if it's some important part of traditions while it is literally human made blunder of our religion. Most of our religion is work of scholars, saints preachers and teachers who with their level of understanding of dharma spread their words. So why this making every single thing as if it is sent by God and should be followed word by word?

 As much as I have read I don't get karmic bad deed for looking at god's as more philosophical and meta physical existence rather than actual beings do I? I believe we all arise from some conscious and god's are just much more closer to the original conscious then us that's why more divine but everyone else with enough penance can also reach that level of connection. Not to say I want that, it's childish to think you can reach God level understanding that easily.... But is being agnostic and not into your culture in form of practice bad, I wanna know my culture but I am not very into practicing all the vrat and festivals. I mostly follow the more important ones in my family. As an agnostic and bisexual if God exists I really want it to be dharmic family not the Abhramic one. The god they believe is more like a tyrant than an actual being of everything. So can I live my more so liberal life or do I really have to be the perfect image of hindu that is spread online.

1gbeylu,Stuck between islam and hinduism,Ominous_chipmunk,2024-10-24 23:16:25+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1gbeylu/stuck_between_islam_and_hinduism/,48,/r/hinduism/comments/1gbeylu/stuck_between_islam_and_hinduism/,hinduism,"Hello, Reddit. I used to be an atheist, but I have come to the conclusion that God necessarily exists. The problem comes in discerning which religion or which manifestation of Him is the true one. I just want to do the right thing, serve, and worship God in the most dignified way possible, loving Him with all my heart as He deserves but I need to know which of all the perspectives is the truth.

I'm stuck between two options: Islam and Hinduism. On one hand, Islam (specifically, the sunni sufi branch) seems to me the most reasonable, simple, philosophically and doctrinally precise, and the least loaded with mythology, tales which many might not take as true (I respect them, either if they are true ir just stories) and metaphors. That said, I feel a sense of restriction, a lot of rigidity, almost like doing a chore (but that, to be honest, might be my fault), etc.

On the other hand, although Hinduism is full of mythology and legends, its vision of God, reality and moksha also seems very, very reasonable and accurate to me, symbolism and hypothetic fictions aside. Additionally, while I don't interpret its deities literally (multiple arms, ornaments, jewels, their legends and mythology, etc.), I underdand that they represent aspects of One God and their representation and the chants used to praise them/Him (He-His aspects) make me very happy, focused and blissful (especially those of Krishna, Vishnu, and Shiva). Personally, the idea of Krishna or Vishnu as the supreme deity (God with a capital ""G""), with Shiva and the rest being His manifestations, satisfies me rationally. However, the idea of reincarnation both 'depresses' and terrifies me, although singing the names of Krishna, Shiva, Vishnu, etc. brings me great happiness, just like when I pray to Allah. Nevertheless, with Hinduism I feel less grounded and less stability. Because of reincarnation (until Moksha/freedom) it feels more diffuse and blurred. Islam makes me feel more grounded and solid, so to speak. I dont pick based on the final afterlife result: Moksha (whatever the type —it seems to vary as regards Vasihnavism, Shaivism or ISCKON—) or Heaven/Paradise. I just stand for the truth. 

It reaches a point where I believe what both traditions (Muslim and Hindu) say, but even though Islam seems more rational to me and I feel bliss, security and a direct connection with Allah (God), I am also greatly attracted to Hinduism and I do not know why. At the same time, although Hinduism common points make a lot of sense to me, I am terrified of reincarnation, of being wrong, and of offending Allah by being led by imagination (loving Krishna as my brother —I am only child and always longed for one—, my son, a friend, etc., for example. Its a devotional practice, if I am not mistaken), or by the experiences of ecstasy, bliss, love for Krishna, peace, relationship with him (Krishna) and joy in meditation as regards Hinduism. Worshipping others besides Allah completely aware is unforgivable by God (Allah) in islam and I feel guilty and scared but when I switch to islam, Krishna and Shiva seem to invite me, participate, love and worship them. But then the loneliness of reincarnation and the security which islam seem to bring strikes me. I cant resist the love and friendship of Krishna and its manifestations (I think my mind aligns with Vasihnavism) and the joy of Hindu tradition. The issue is that in Hinduism there is only One Supreme God (as in islam) but He can be incarnated (avatars) as Jesus and artistically represented, which is a hideous unforgivable blasphemy in islam. 

I think about this so much and go in circles to the point where my head hurts, and I often get depressed because I feel stuck. What do you think I should do in this situation? It's a constant battle between fear, reason, happiness, and emptiness. I'm going crazy. What do you suggest? I just Want to do the right thing and love God. But I feel torn by both right and left EXTREME opposites.

My luck in terms of my career seems to be stagnating

I am being very specific here - career luck seems to be stagnating. I'm saying this because I consider myself lucky in other aspects - I have great parents, decent family life, decent financial stability but a below average job. 

Why I am saying a below average career - I have double masters and my business school was one of the top B schools in the US. I enrolled in the the school looking at the career prospects after graduating with MBA. However, my career did not skyrocket at all and continued to grow at a snails pace whereas some of my colleagues are already Directors, Sr. Directors and some are even partners at consulting companies earning millions.

I have worked equally hard. I did my MBA while working full time and I remember having 16 hours days because 10 hours were at work, 6 hours studying, preparing for interviews etc. But I didn't get a good opportunity during my graduation unlike my peers. Even after graduation, it's been a very steep climb. Last week I was almost about to clear my final interview round at a big tech company when they informed me that they went ahead with an internal candidate. This is happening way too often to a point where I am thinking it's some kind of a pattern and indication from the universe that this isn't for me.

I have always been an achiever throughout except my professional success in the last 10 years of my life. I have a feeling that the only thing I can really do is accept the fate

I don't know if this is the appropriate sub nor an appropriate request to make, and I honestly feel a bit shameful for bringing this up to you all. And this is going to be a bit long so please stay till the end.

I am 20, doing job and near my workplace, there is Hanuman temple where I go daily to do Pooja and Jaap. The temple is managed by an old couple, who as far as I know don't have children and are not able to work due to their age.

Yesterday, I visited and the couple has a conversation with me. They told that the temple is running by what people put near the idol, which is very less for them to buy Prasad,  Ghee and special flowers which we make for Hanuman Dada.

They said they can't ask students, but they are requesting people who are earning to donate whatever they can or want to atleast buy basic things for Temple. People sometimes barely put coins or neither they help at all. Let alone I didn't even get to the point of their expenses.

I tried to donate as much as can from my side, but due to my small salary, I had to hold myself back because I also have to manage my expenses. I thought of sharing it here, because I can help them before this New Year. I know it sounds a bit off, also there can be hesitation, I too hesitated to post this here.


I am requesting on behalf of that couple to donate whatever amount you want to donate (1,10,20,50). Whatever the amount is collected, 100% of that plus my little contribution will go to that temple. I know it sounds fishy and untrustworthy, but I feel very bad for the temple and couple.

If you feel like helping, you may DM for the UPI. Also if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Thank You for reading till end.

Context: A couple of years ago, I was known for my Hindu artworks on this subreddit. However, after starting college, I had to stop creating art and thus my earnings also stopped.

Recently, moving to a new city for an internship in my 4th semester has drained my limited funds completely. I was hoping to continue the internship as a full-time job, but my college isn't allowing it, which has left me in a very difficult situation. I’m now stuck between ruining my career and ending my life as I have no funds left to sustain my expenses on the campus.

To sustain myself for the remaining six months of college, I’m looking to sell all my existing artworks. I’m offering the original versions and their intellectual rights as a way to express my gratitude for any support I receive.

If any of you are still interested in my artworks and would like to own the original pieces, please reach out to me. It would mean a lot for me.

So I'm currently reading Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana and came acrose this Shloka in Baalkanda where Sri Narad Ji recites Ramayana in brief to Maharishi Valmiki Ji.
The shloka is प्रेषणं वायु पुत्रस्य भारतेन समागम |
राम अभिषेक अभ्युदयं सर्व सैन्य विसर्जनम् |
स्व राष्ट्र रंजनम् च एव वैदेह्यः च विसर्जनम् || 1-3-38 

हनुमान को भरत से मिलने भेजना, क्योंकि उन्होंने प्रतिज्ञा की थी कि यदि राम समय पर नहीं आए तो वे आत्मदाह कर लेंगे; राम का राज्याभिषेक महोत्सव; वानरों की सभी सैन्य टुकड़ियों को वापस भेज देना; राम द्वारा अपनी प्रजा की प्रसन्नता के लिए राज्य चलाना, तथा उनकी ही प्रसन्नता के लिए वैदेहनंदिनी सीता को भी वन में त्याग देना । 

Now I'm aware of the debate of Bhagwan Sri Rama leaving Mata Sita being in Valmiki Ramayana but here in Balkanda it states that.
So please I request all of you learned individuals here to help me understand if this incident actually happened or not. Will appreciate your response.

I believe that ISKCON has Krishna as the Godhead rather than Brahman as described in the Upanishads.  I don't wish to comment on this or stir this up so please know I mean no offense in this regard, but this is the foundation of my question.

My question is, it appears to me that ISKCON is a form of Advaita Vedanta in the sense that Krishna is both deity AND the all encompassing One or Source, as described in the Bhagavad Gita.  I think that ISKCON is considered a monastic school in Hinduism too.  So, is it the former, latter or both?  I'm asking because I am hammering out my beliefs and I feel like I am getting somewhere with it after so many years of swimming in the ocean of Sanatana Dharma.

I am an Indian Hindu, and I am very devotional about my faith. I wanted to explore how other religions discuss their gods and the origins of life. A doubt occurred to me: Is everything about our religion historical, or is it written with exaggeration?

For example, Christianity mentions that Jesus existed around 2000 years ago. The story appears to be about actual people who were Jews.

Islam similarly recounts the story of Prophet Muhammad and Adam, which is comparable to Christianity.

However, Hindu scriptures mention Lord Rama as having existed around 7000 years ago—an astounding claim, considering how historically inaccurate it might seem. Some texts even suggest the Ramayana took place 1.6 million years ago, which is an extraordinary number. The stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata mention flying vehicles and concepts like time agnosticity (e.g., Kalki, the crow), as well as the communication between Sanjaya and Dhritarashtra. Some technologies described in these texts are things we don’t even have today.

Is it possible that these were written as exaggerations? I am just a curious mind. I apologize if I inadvertently hurt anyone’s sentiments. Please correct me if any of my understanding is incorrect.",39,True,Hindū Scripture(s),,0.55,False,Hindū Scripture(s)

Why Bhagwaan let so many people suffer and never comes to help. But you forget the most important thing. You must see within yourself first, do you have firm steadfast belief in Bhagwan?      
      
       
Learn to blame yourself. Instead of raising questions at God. Unless you blame yourself for everything, God will never come to help you. So when does Bhagwan come to help you? Only if you have utmost firm belief in God like Prahlaada.     
     
      
Hiranyakashipu was father of Prahlada, who asked to destroy all Vishnu temples and kill all Vishnu worshipers. Hiranyakashipu and his army killed all the innocent worshippers of Vishnu. But still Hiranyakashipu and his army couldn't kill Prahlada. Why did Vishnu not help hundreds of thousands of innocent worshippers getting killed by Hiranyakashipu and his servants, but only helped Prahlaada?       
      
         

Because only Prahlaada had utmost firm belief in Vishnu. Bhagwaan Vishnu was taking test of devotees in form of injustice of Hiranyakashipu, and those innocent worshippers gave up and their belief in God was shattered. This is why Vishnu let them be killed at hands of Hiranyakashipu. But Prahlaada on the other hand, was steadfast in belief of Vishnu, therefore Vishnu saved him from any kind of problems. And Prahlada became one of the most prominent Bhaktas (devotees) of Vishnu.       
         
        
So your belief in Bhagwaan should be like this. Completely firm. Remember, this world is ultimately Bhagwaan itself, and there is no wrong or right, justice or injustice. Because Paramatma cannot differentiate between good and bad, at all. A sinner who harms and troubles others is completely equal for God as is a pious virtuous person who helps and protects others, because God lacks ability to differentiate between wrong and right. So for God, there is no difference between a wrong doer and right doer. So before blaming God, you should look into yourself. Only then can you realise the shining Bhagwaan residing within your consciousness. Until you overcome Maya of Bhagwaan, you can never attain Bhagwan ji. So keep chanting the nectar like most divine powerful name of Bhagwan who is always present, only when you remember Bhagwan with true mind, then only you will get Darshana. Otherwise, God will never come for you. So be completely true mind, completely fully true, and you will get darshan of Bhagwan ji. And if you don't then your Bhakti is weak, you love of God is not true, and real. So make your Bhakti and mind completely true, then you will get darshan of Bhagwan ji.",21,True,Other,,0.82,False,Other

I was wondering if Hinduism has ever had or is developing a critical academic tradition like how Abrahamic religions have done. And if not, why?

Biblical studies has been a large field for decades now, with various analyses of both Jewish and Christian texts been 
done. Quranic/Islamic studies, though not as prominent as biblical studies, is a also a somewhat mature field, with many papers being published on anachronomisms within the Quran, analysis of reliability of Hadith, etc. Such studies are scientific in nature and the academics often do not belong to the same religion as the texts they are analyzing. 

In this fields, academics are the ones doing the work, not priests or maulanas. I feel like I haven’t seen such a field emerge for Hinduism. Is there any particular reason why such a field hasn’t gained traction?",13,True,Question - General,,0.89,False,Question - General

But falsely saying something is an interpolation because you can't explain those things, is wrong and droha against Shastra itself, which is the vachana/orders/leelas of Bhagavan. Similar is the case with the greatest literature of earth, the pramaana on the Lord's Ramavataaram Sri Adikavi Sri Valmiki rachit Sharnagati-Shastram Sri Ramayanam, specifically its Uttara Kandam, the last Kanda. 

This is a recent phenomena, new-gen Hindus and neo-Hindus, upon not being able to explain the Leelas of Rama Piraan and Sita Piratti, declare Uttara Kandam as totally inauthentic, fake, interpolated and prakshipta. While Traditional Sampradayas, like Sri Vaishnava, Madhva, etc, consider Uttara Kanda totally a part of Sri Ramayanam. I belong to the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya of Sheshavatara Bhagavan Ramanujacharya, and Sri Ramayanam is the one of the MOST important Granthas of our Sampradaya. No Sampradaya has given as much importance to Sri Ramayanam as Us Sri Vaishnavas, to explain the concept of Sharnagati to Perumal. 

Here are some resources which have refuted Neo-Hindu claims of Uttara Kanda being interpolated with proper proof:

I consider myself a spiritual person—I read the Ramayana, Bhagavad-Gita, and other scriptures, but one thing I rarely do is puja or sadhana. I don’t engage in regular worship or spiritual practices.

What’s worse is that I only seem to remember God when I’m in trouble or desperately need something. When life is going smoothly, I often forget. But when I’m facing a crisis, that’s when I start praying or remembering Him. This makes me feel deeply guilty. It feels selfish to only seek God’s presence when I need help, and that thought stops me from praying even when I’m in a crisis.

Instead of reaching out in those moments, I tell myself, ""How bad of me to only remember God now. I don’t deserve to ask for anything."" Then I just stop praying altogether, thinking I should accept whatever life gives me as the result of my karma.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with the guilt of remembering God only when you’re in need? I’d appreciate any advice or insights.",5,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

So I am looking for something like that, but for Hindu scripture. 

I read through the starter pack info, and it states: ""In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).)

Namaste. I'm an average Hindu who takes part in rituals and also believes in our devatā-s.

I'm also a firm believer in the Aryan Migration Theory ( AMT ).

A few months back I started reading stuff said by white indologists where they stated that Lord Kṛṣṇa as an historical figure was ""Non-Aryan"" because of his dark skin.

Got really confused after all this. After a month or two I came across amazing blogs run by Hindus who are also believers of the AMT and are geniuses when it comes to the Ārya Vedic tradition and the history of Sanātana Dharma.

 things which i learnt from them were :

1 - Kṛṣṇa was a prince of the Yadu Clan , one of the 5 Ṛgvedic lunar Ārya Clans ( Alongside Turvasu , Pūru , Anu and Druhyu )

2 - The Sub-clan of the Yadu-s to which Kṛṣṇa is said to have hailed from : The Sātvata-s are mentioned in the Śruti. The Ṛgvedic Aitereya Brāhmaṇa mentions them (Satvat-s ) as being South ( Probably South of the Kuru-s ) i.e the modern day Braj region. the Śukla Yajurvedīya Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa mentions that the Bharata-s seized the Aśvamedha horse of the Satvat-s , confirming that the Yādava Satvat-s were Indo-Āryans who followed the Vedic faith.

3 - Now Kṛṣṇa's skin colour. Well there's no doubt about him being dark complexioned. But we need to understand that the Ārya-s did afterall mix with the Locals. And he is not the only one who was Dark-complexioned. Drauapdī - the princess of Pañchāla ( one of the 2 centers of Vedic culture )was also Dark complexioned.

4 - By the time of the Mahābhārata , the Yadu-s had many sub-clans : The Satvat-s , Vṛṣṇis , Andhakas , Bhojas , Daśārhas , Madhu's etc.. . Kṛṣṇa was the first cousin of the Pāṇḍavas : Princes of the Kuru Dynasty.

Well I have alot more to say on this topic but I'll stop here as I think all this might bore alot of people.

So I'll end with saying that skin colour might have been a identification marker for the early Ārya-s but as many generations passed , they undoubtedly mixed with local tribes and also tanned ( bcs of the subcontinent's weather ).

Also , if you don't believe in the Aryan Migration/invasion theory , that's completely fine ! Everyone is free to have their own opinion , a thing i love about my religion and culture.

If anyone wants to add something to this or if anyone is interested in the history of the Yadu clan and Kṛṣṇa or if you have any info or remark regarding my post , please comment !

   I am 33 years old & from childhood I had fascination for the shivling. I loved doing abhishek on the shivling & sitting in Shiv temple.

   I am going through the final phase of my Sade Sati (Vrishchik rashi). I am doing Om Namah Shivay japa & Shivling puja. I heard Mr. Rajarshi Nandy say on YouTube that lord Shiva does not respond faster & You have to worship him in Bhairava form as Bhairava responds faster & also helps get rid of Graha dosh/Sade saati.

They say It is necessary to go through Artha and Kama to be able to finally attain Moksha but then there are also verses in numerous scriptures that indulgence into Wealth and Lust increases it further and that It can never be satisfied.

I don't really understand that If Wealth and Lust restrain humans from liberation by binding them to their materialistic pleasures, why do they precede the ultimate goal when most people are led astray after their indulgence into both and are dead long before they have the luxury to pursue Moksha?

Are they trying to merely justify the indulgence into Wealth and Lust in the pretext of 'I am doing all this because I want to attain Moksha eventually'

And what's more problematic is the Moksha part is left for the end when one is inching towards his death.
How could liberation be so cheap when you
spent your prime years in attaining Artha and Kama, that you now expect to so easily attain Moksha with that decrepit body and mind of yours in old age?

I have been practicing Hinduism for a while now, but only recently have started attending satsang at my local temple. I find it to be a very powerful experience, providing me the opportunity to connect with God and with other people who share my religion, but I’m not entirely sure how I fit in to the practice of temple worship.

I am non-binary, and this presents some challenges in the environment of a temple, where certain rules apply for men vs. women. Men sit in the front, women sit in the back. Men may speak to the priest, women may not. Even where one puts shoes, and where one enters the temple is dictated by gender. Dress is also a bit tricky – as much as I want my attention to be fully on devotion to the divine, wearing feminine clothing to align with my assigned gender at birth causes me to feel dysphoric, and the intense panic this causes distracts me. I know I need to separate myself from my body, but dysphoria is proving to be a hinderance rather than a help in this endeavor – it causes me to overly focus on my physical appearance rather than be able to ignore it.

There is another wrinkle in this, which is that I am white, and do not come from an Indian culture. Everyone at the temple has been very welcoming, encouraging, and kind to me as I have explored and learned, but it is very clear that I am still an outsider. I am worried that, if they learned I exist in this space between man and woman, I would no longer have a community.

I feel stuck. I either have to be dishonest while I worship at the temple, endure some pretty nasty dysphoria, and keep secrets from people who have been so kind to me, or I reveal my identity, am honest while I worship, and no longer have to deal with dysphoria, but I risk no longer having a community.

So Deepavali is in few days. Amavasya Tithi is going to start from 3:52 PM on 31st October to 6:16 PM on 1st November. I hope you and your family have planned well for the coming occasion. I wish that you find prosperity in your new ventures and your relations become better and peace and spirituality surround you.

Well, another thing which comes around Deepavali is the sudden concern of environmentalists for noise and sound pollution. Personally, I would recommend you to keep these things in mind while buying firecrackers:

1. Buy Indian brands only
2. Buy CSIR-NEERI-certified green logo fireworks only
3. Light and show are always more pleasing than sound and smoke
4. Don't misuse the firecrackers and harm anyone or anything
5. Manage your finances better, firecrackers are good but so are lights, sweets and rangolis

And also, for those who are saying that firecrackers aren't there in the culture of Deepavali,

**Skanda Purana Verse** [**2.4.9.65**](http://2.4.9.65)

**तुलासंस्थे सहस्रांशौ प्रदोषे भूतदर्शयोः ।**  
**उल्काहस्ता नराः कुर्युः पितॄणां मार्गदर्शनम् ॥ ६५ ॥**

When the Sun is in the sign of Libra and Pradosha has gone yesterday, people hold ""Ulkaa"" in their hand to guide their ancestors.

Though Ulkaas of then are different from fire crackers of today, but we can say that it is our culture, not some foreign influence. But at the same time, though there is no bad intention in our religion, poisons do exist as made by corporates for profits.

So, enjoy Deepavali, with pride, spirituality and responsibility.",0,True,Hindū Festival,festival,1.0,False,Hindū Festival

I've seen an increasing number of Shakta users on this sub and I've been receiving many repetitive queries. To help everyone here is some basic information that anyone interested in Shakta Sampradaya Should review.

# Tantra

Unlike the popular perception ""Tantra"" refers to revealed texts where Shiva/Bhairava is speaking with Shakti/Bhairavi. These texts are critical in current Shakta practices because most Shakta worship is outlined in these texts. Some texts commonly confused with Tantras are *Damar* (Shakti speaking with Shiva), Yamala (Both speaking with each other), Shaiva Agama, and Shakta Agama. Those Shakta practices that come from tantras are referred to as *Tantric/Tantrokata* and those that come from Puranas are *Pauranic/Laukik*.

# Vidya

Mantras for Devi are known as Vidyas.

# Mahavidya

The ""great vidya"" or the great mantras. Dasha Mahavidyas are 10 mantras that can grant liberation to the practitioner. But just like Dasha Avatars of Vishnu, various lists of 10 mantras are accepted in different sects. Moreover, there are more than 10 mahavidyas, some sources even speak of 7 Crore Mahavidyas. The popular 10 are:

1. Maa Kali
2. Maa Tara
3. Maa Lalita
4. Maa Bhuvaneshwari
5. Maa Tripura Bhairavi
6. Maa Chinnamastika
7. Maa Dhumavati
8. Maa Baglamukhi
9. Maa Matangi
10. Maa Kamala

Though these forms are referred to as Mahavidya, technically their specific mantras are the Mahavidyas. In the Shakta understanding, there is no difference between the mantra and the deity. Some of the above forms are quite secretive and it is unwise to reveal many details about them. For Example, Maa Chinnamastika is a closely guarded secret, her mantra may only be given to someone after several decades of practice. Some of these forms are also propitiated for pryogas and abhichar (to be discussed). For Example, Maa Baglamukhi is associated with Stambhana Shakti and invoked by many for very materialistic causes.

# Kula

Kulas are families of tantric lineages. A kula worships the same form of Devi as the supreme, using the tantras taught within the Kula. For Example: For in Kali Kula, Maa Kali is the supreme form of Maa and all other devis are her swaroopas, their worship is based on Tantras like Brihad Neela Tantra. Currently, Kali Kula and Sri (Maa Lalita Tripura Sundari) Kula are two of the most dominant Kulas, most shaktas will fall in either of these two. Outside of these families are uninitiated practitioners who worship in the pauranic mode. Amongst the uninitiated Maa Durga is the most commonly worshipped form. (Sad Note: Durga Kula was systematically decimated under the Mughals and has few practitioners.)

# Aacharam

Aacharam refers to the mode of worship. There are 7 aacharams:

* **Dakshinachar**: Dakshin means right (hence the right-hand path). Rules in Dakshinachar are very similar to that in Pauranic worship and the samagri used is satvik.
* **Samayachar**: Samaya is a higher form of Dakshinachar. In this mode, no samagri is used and worship is purely done mentally accompanied by mantras.
* **Vamachar**: Vama means left (hence the left-handed path). It is opposite to normal forms of worship. This is the path where the infamous Pancha makar (discussed in detail later) comes in. Vamachar is one of the most misunderstood forms of Shakta worship. Most discussions around it on the internet are misguided.
* **Veerachar**: This is a more intense form of Vamachar. Samagri becomes very strange and practices are done in cremation grounds or secluded places. A true Veerachar Sadhak coming online to speak of these practices is rare and honestly not expected.
* **Mishrachar**: Mix between Dakshin and Vama practices
* **Kaulachar**: More intense version of Samaya and Veera practices. What exactly is kaulachar is open to interpretation and various masters from Bhaskara Raya Makin to Krishnanada Aghavashish have differing views.
* **Divyachar:** This aacharam is the highest state reached by any practitioner. Identification with the deity is so strong every action becomes worship.

# Prayoga and Abhichar

Both refer to the application of power generated through the mantra sadhana. Shakta practices are unique in this aspect. While most other sects would use mantra shakti purely for spiritual gains, in Shakta practices it is very much possible to apply mantra shakti to help with materialistic problems. This application is known as prayoga **if and only if the deity grants explicit permission**. If permission from the deity is not there it is known as **Abhichar**. Six/eight prayogas are there:

1. **Shanti:** creating peace
2. **Pushti:** creating prosperity \[*Subset of Shanti*\]
3. **Vidveshan:** creating conflict
4. **Mohana:** attracting an entity
5. **Vashikarana:** controlling an entity \[*Subset of Mohana*\]
6. **Stambhana:** Stopping the natural flow of something
7. **Uchhatan:** forcing an entity to leave
8. **Marana:** killing an entity

This aspect of the practice is interpreted variously, for general knowledge I have only provided the generic meaning of these terms. It is important to know that both these terms are controversial and each lineage has a slightly different understanding. For example, in my lineage, such practices are meant to be applied internally to help in faster spiritual progress only. But some lineages do apply these to external issues.

# The 5 Ms

One of the most controversial aspects of Vamachar practices. On a literal level, 5Ms are:

1. **Madya**: Alcohol
2. **Matsya**: Fish
3. **Mamsa**: Meat
4. **Mudra**: Grain
5. **Maithun**: Intercourse

Needless to say, some lineages don't take these literally. Madya is interpreted to mean ecstasy of Japa, Matsya is pranayama, Mamsa is dhyana, Mudra is actions, and Maithuna is the union of Kundalini with Sahasrhara Chakra. There are, however lineages that perform these rites literally as well.

This is the first post in a series of posts aimed at dispelling unnecessary confusion regarding these practices and terms. As usual, leaving questions in the comments would help everyone. My DMs remain open to all, but since I've been getting repetitive queries I feel it is better to address them here.

But my question comes from a place of curiosity and not orthodoxy.

As a child ,I don't remember from whom exactly, I had heard that each yuga corresponds with one of the four varnas － that is, satyug is the age of knowledge (bramhins), treta the age of valour and power (kshtriya), dwapar the age of commerce (vaisya), and kalyug the age of iron age, the age of labour (shudra). That is not to say one yuga is inherently better than the other (which is another conversation altogether) － if I remember correctly that person said that this theory was put forth by Swami Vivekanand.
However, I have gone through numerous quotes and speeches by Swami Vivekanand and I haven't found the evidence for this.

Hello. I feel like there are two parts of my brain. One hindu and one the old confused one. The old one used to call the kathas of the pastimes of gods as stories and fictions with philosophical meaning while the hindu one sees lord krishna as everything. You can call the old one the epitome of gen z. While a small child I was very devotional but as I grew up in my preteens my own shortcomings (those according to hinduism) and my environment took me away. I felt forced to criticize religion because my slight interest in science in childhood turned into a loveless obsession for science in my teens. Currently the new me says that science and technology isn't important because limited knowledge of this material is enough. What is really necessary is peace harmony and knowledge of life and rights and that is what hinduism gives. I was also tempted by the well managed, clean, technological side of the western world (according to what i saw in that age) and I associated that to their religion. so i strayed from my original path of hinduism the one that I belong to. So nowadays I can't do bhakti properly because my old immature arguements still come in my mind and I cant stop it. I also have a problem. I see images and have another type of thought, lets call it energy for now.  The statements my old self said about hinduism still comes to my mind and that creates an energy of irreligion which tries to pull me away from hinduism. I cant watch western content nowadays because the energy of western faith pulls me. I cant study anything in my school because the energy of modern academia and science pulls me away. I was a decent student before and my current self could utilize it better. Now I know that the only purpose education serves me is getting a job and fullfilling my karma and completing my responsibilities towards my family. But back then I was impressed by science and  didn't know the importance of a guru. So i used my own unconventional obsessive ways to learn science which put too much pressure in my mind. I tried to be purely scientific back then and completly rejected religion, ethics, morales. I used immature logic. I used immature buddhi which hadn't seen the light of god. My theories were of charwak types. I used to think self service was the only virtue. I used to think that I should serve myself and make myself happy and there was nothing as rules and virtue . I would argue desparately to save that theory and use obssesive means such as chanting the same sentence over and over again to reinforce it in me. I desperately tried to increase intelligence and scientific aptitude but now I realize that virtue and god are more important than that. I was over expressive and used to over exaggerate things. My life was in complete tamas. I would spend all time in the useless never- satisfying worldly pleasures. I used to magnificantly express my pain and tried to get others acceptance that I was in pain. I was extremely sexual and commited some sexual misdeeds. Now i accept what acharya prasanth said. If there is a river bathe in it dont question where it came from. But I used to overthink in unnecessary matters. I dont know surely but there was a hidden need to be all knowing in me. I delibarately didn't exercise and rejected pranayams because I chanted to myself that intelligence is necessary and not body. But I now know that body is also important and the body is the sadhan for dharma. However the old tendencies still come as energies and memories and attack me. I still kind of return to those tendencies and I have to deny them by extreme force. While exerting this force I am in a very bad state and this has troubled my parents greatly. Even when I am writing about my past self it feels like it is returning and I have to write counter statements that prove the old self wrong to remind myself. I nowadays think I was a dysfunctioning aatma because I could never work all. I would never go in process and go progressively. Back then I always wanted to be perfectly good all of a sudden. I could never stop snacking all day long. If something slightly good happened I would immediately get relaxed and not work instead. I am always concentrating and in some sort of mini-meditation and even if someone sneezes I am greatly disturbed. I again use extreme force and reject this feeling which causes other distress. I want to be below god and serve him and embrace him but sometimes I uncontrolably create stories which makes me look great and above god. The religious part in me. Majority of these problems started when I was 11 some were there since childhood. After I wrote all this about my past I feel like I have returned to my past self again. Before writing this I was remembering lord krishna every moment but as I wrote this I stopped. I was afraid of using notepad for writing this because it reminded me of the energy of the past ( I used to use notepad a lot in the past) when I was a very bad person. Nowadays I don't question culture and religion but in the latest video of acharya prasanth i heard the girl talking about rejecting culture and religion as superstitions which gave me the energy of lack of belief. I want to be a healthy individual and invest my time in doing my karma fullfilling my responsibilities and studying hinduism.

  
I think this gives the gist of the problem I am in. I am very sorry for clumsy writing my mind isn't in the state nowadays for organized writing. Thank you for bearing with my writing and giving some time to read this. Please suggest me what to do.",3,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

We don't believe in creation from nothing. The world existed as potential within Brahman, which is then transformed into gross state by Brahman. 

Mundaka upanishad compares production of the world to a spider producing a spiderweb from itself. The spiderweb already existed within the spider in a subtle state before being made visible. If that was not the case, the spider could have never produced the web. Just like a cockroach can't produce a web, because the cockroach doesn't contain the web within itself in a subtle state.

Whatever you see in the world have always existed within Brahman. They are just transformed from a subtle state to visible state. Something that doesn't exist at all cannot be produced, just like you can't produce a mango tree from an apple seed, because there is no mango tree in the apple seed.

Just a couple of days ago, I found myself in a situation where I couldn’t help but compare myself to others. I saw people around me doing so much better in various aspects—looks, money, and more—and it filled me with anger and frustration. I started questioning why they seem to have it all while I feel stuck.

Hinduism has so many ways of worship and beliefs that I don’t know where to start or whom to believe. I come from a well-to-do family, but we aren’t very affluent or happy, and I have a somewhat dysfunctional family. Whenever I see someone struggling to make ends meet or being treated differently because of their flaws or looks, I feel deeply sad and angry. I often vent to God, questioning what that person did to deserve such treatment. I understand it’s their karma, but I can’t help but wonder where humanity has gone—why is everyone so selfish?

For the past few days, I’ve been feeling disturbed and distracted, making it hard to pray and connect with Lord Hanuman like I usually do. I’m also struggling with distractions from the opposite gender, parties, and material desires. I find myself confused about what’s right and wrong in these areas. Some people say that since Hanuman ji is a Brahmachari, I shouldn’t pursue attraction to the opposite gender, but I’m torn about that as well.

At just 19, I feel I’m too young for all of this. It feels heavy and philosophical compared to my peers, and sometimes I wonder if I should have entered into this level of thinking so soon.

I want to know how to worship effectively and how to find peace of mind amid these feelings. I’ve been seeking answers to a lot of questions, but it feels overwhelming. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you navigate these feelings while maintaining your faith? Any advice or perspectives would be greatly appreciated.

1g7vetu,Did Krishna know I was going to turn into a devotee? ,kekman777,2024-10-20 11:07:13+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g7vetu/did_krishna_know_i_was_going_to_turn_into_a/,7,/r/hinduism/comments/1g7vetu/did_krishna_know_i_was_going_to_turn_into_a/,hinduism,"Krishna can see indefinitely into the future. Did he know I would become a devotee one day? 

There are some things going on about in my life. 

The most prominent is my schizophrenia. It has made me extremely unenthused towards life in general. I am so apathetic towards life that I don't react to situations the same way as other people do. I also find it much easier to believe that the world is temporary (much like a simulation) that is engulfed in an illusion that will one day end. The good or bad happenings in the world don't affect me as they used to. 

Second is my severe acne. I believe that my acne has robbed me of my previously good looks, and now I have become below average. I used to be extremely frustrated because of this reason, but now I have started to somehow accept the fact that it is what it is. I used to never want to leave house in the fear of showing my face in public, but now I am getting over that and don't care too much about my looks. I am not vain anymore. 

Third could be my inability to find and hold a job (due to my mental health issues). I do have a job now, but I have found that after a long time of not having one, I have become extremely detached to it. I work honestly, but I don't really care about the money anymore. I am ready to part with any amount of my income or even all of it because it doesn't seem valuable anymore. I guess not having money to spend for the longest time has made me that way. I have kind of learnt to live with the bare minimum. 

Fourth again is my schizophrenia. I have become uninterested in carnal pleasures, like physical and deeper contacts with the opposite gender. I see it only as the means to reproduction. I don't find pleasure in actions i once used to find happiness in, like eating fast food, drinking, sex, video games, touring, sightseeing, etc. 

The thing is though, all my problems started to act up before I became a devotee of Krishna. If Krishna can see into the future and could tell I would become a devotee one day, can I still think of these problems as special arrangements made by Krishna to detach me from the world? 

Or is it all just a general misfortune that has fallen upon me? I truly believe these problems I have faced have helped me get over a lot of materialistic desires. 

Thank you.

1g7tp59,A Hindu devotee with DID (multiple personalities).. our experience,jakemyhomie,2024-10-20 08:56:03+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g7tp59/a_hindu_devotee_with_did_multiple_personalities/,11,/r/hinduism/comments/1g7tp59/a_hindu_devotee_with_did_multiple_personalities/,hinduism,"I am making this post because I do not see this being discussed on any online platform despite many of our deities having such aspects or avtars. I hope this post can act as a support for others like us who feel alone, and inspire more discussion. 

I am currently in my 20s and was born into Hinduism. Received the official diagnosis an year ago but I've known my soulmates since we were children. I refer to them as soulmates rather than alters because that's who they are to me. English, Hindi or Sanskrit does not have a word for our relationship. The closest description I can give you is how Shiva is to Shakti but more human (certainly not as divine)

My earliest memory of them goes to when I was 4 years old, the age when our personality starts to develop. In my practice of Hinduism it's considered that a child is a personification of God until age 5, because after the 5th birthday the ego develops . If you do research on DID you find that the distinct identities (or egos) are caused because of severe turbulence and fear in a child's attachment to the people around them. Either way I remember retaining these identities and over time we developed as distinct people

We all have our own relationship with Hinduism. We come from a Brahmin family and our mother is the most devout person I know, her sadhana is on par with several pandits and she is now on the path to actualization. She influenced us very heavily and raised us with these customs. But our path is very different from hers, and even from each other. I personally am following in her guidance and my method of worship is stotras, rituals and meditation - sattvic with some borrowed tantric elements. My soul-sister worships through bhajans and songs. My soul-brother is completely different, in the sense he sees the gods as a friend/parent and speaks to them as such. The one similarity between us all is that our ishta-devata is Devi despite being born into a Vaishnav family. We believe in Shaktism mostly.

Due to our unique situation it is hard to find a guru. I am still not initiated in this path. The only ones who know of us are the gods. They are my gurus.

What I have noticed is that we are treated independent of each other. Like three souls inhabiting one body. I am still in the early stages but I can feel the energies from the dieties and their acknowledgement for each of us is different. They also require unique things from each of us, but have common things we all should do. For example we all chant Devi's stotras every day but I am encouraged to meditate. My soul-sister is encouraged to read the mahakathas

It's interesting but it raises the question - are we treated as seperate people in rituals? It may be straightforward in say a satyanarayana vrat. But what about marriage? Shraddha? I can't find any information in our scriptures. 

Another question is how we came to be. Hinduism so far has no explanation for DID. I can assure you my soulmates are not entities possessing me. It would be hilarious if they were, considering how human we all are. I recall my mother had prayed to the three Mahadevis before my conception - maybe it's that? 

My final question is what would happen to us upon death? Would our karma be judged individually or as part of all of us? Would we integrate into one soul in our future lives before moksha? 

It feels refreshing typing this post because I cannot find such communities online easily. It's easy to lose spirituality when you're like us but we have been connected to it, perhaps because of our past lives. 

Anyways I'd like to hear your thoughts.

Which makes me wonder why would anyone read this scripture in first place if not for this mystic knowledge.

I also found no recitation of this on youtube which is very sad because the sanskrit wordings of this text are the most difficult words I have ever come across and the script used is old hindi as well, not the modern standardized devnagri script.

I only found a south Indian channel teaching about this Samb Panchshika but its in Telugu, which i dont understand.

Regardless, any help on this scripture would be really helpful.

But knowledge was not enough to heal those deep wounds .

One day i was talking to a friend and he initiated the topic of Gayatri mantra and said though it is commonly understood that Gayatri mantra is dedicated to the rising sun , it is more of symbolism . The real meaning of ""sabita"" is the Hiranya Garva ( in hinduism its the golden womb or the bright point that is beginning of everything )  . It refers to the eternal sun or the midnight sun that shines the experience . That was the beginning of my Gayatri sadhana as i was reading a lot about advaita and mystery of  consciousness  . I Started chanting the mantra using rudrakhya mala . Its been 3 months and there has been considerable improvements in my overall wellbeing . My mindset is positive . Health improved a lot . And to my surprise i have recovered my photographic memory which i used to have during school days . .   Plus minus overall i can say finally i am at peace . Not saying Gayatri mantra "" will work for everyone .  It was given to me and it did work for me  .  There are innumerable numbers of mantra in Hinduism . Even every major deity have their gayatri mantra . . What i can say is  mantra chanting  is a powerful tool in our religion .

The pollution caused by crackers is a problem really, crackers cause both noise and air pollution + not to mention land pollution when used crackers are not thrown on proper places... 

Diwali is a festival of lights and happiness, lets make it peaceful.. Nature is the best gift of god, we see nature itself as a part of God so why cause harm to it even if its a little bit?

I don't care what other communities do, we are not them, don't start comparing us to any community ""If they do it, why not we?"" because I personally don't want impurity in our community as a self, these crackers definitely cause harm to nature and animals (not to mention most of them are chinese made). I get raged when I see our other community members getting angry when someone sites the pollution or problem caused by this, its a fact, accept it and stop doing it!   
Why are we even bursting crackers? when none of our religious scriptures ask for it (ik crackers didn't exist back then), so if they celebrated Diwali without crackers, we must too! Its like our river situation, Ma Ganga being the most sacred is also the most polluted, for us the followers of Sanatana Dharma, whole nature is sacred, so better protect it and make pollution free rather than causing harm to it in any possible way.",31,True,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living,,0.48,False,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living

shark-shaped earrings are swinging to and fro, who is beautifully shining in the divine realm of Gokula, who  
\[due to the offense of breaking the pot of yogurt that His mother was churning into butter and then stealing  
the butter that was kept hanging from a swing\] is quickly running from the wooden grinding mortar in fear  
of mother Yasoda, but who has been caught from behind by her who ran after Him with greater speed—to  
that Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, I offer my humble obeisances.  
  
(2) Seeing the whipping stick in His mother’s hand,\] He is crying and rubbing His eyes again and again with  
His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with fear, and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is  
marked with three lines like a conchshell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to crying. To  
this Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, whose belly is bound not with ropes but with His mother’s pure love, I offer  
my humble obeisances.  
  
(3) By such childhood pastimes as this He is drowning the inhabitants of Gokula in pools of ecstasy, and  
is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in knowledge of His supreme majesty and opulence that He is  
only conquered by devotees whose pure love is imbued with intimacy and is free from all conceptions of awe  
and reverence. With great love I again offer my obeisances to Lord Damodara hundreds and hundreds of times.  
  
(4) 0 Lord, although You are able to give all kinds of benedictions, I do not pray to You for the boon of  
impersonal liberation, nor the highest liberation of eternal life in Vaikuntha, nor any other boon \[which may  
be obtained by executing the nine processes of bhakti\]. O Lord, I simply wish that this form of Yours as  
Bala Gopala in Vrindavana may ever be manifest in my heart, for what is the use to me of any other boon  
besides this?  
  
(5) 0 Lord, Your lotus face, which is encircled by locks of soft black hair tinged with red, is kissed again and  
again by mother Yasoda, and Your lips are reddish like the bimba fruit. May this beautiful vision of Your lotus  
face be ever manifest in my heart. Thousands and thousands of other benedictions are of no use to me.

curse of Narada and made into great devotees by You in Your form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden  
grinding mortar, in the same way, please give to me Your own prema-bhakti. I only long for this and have  
no desire for any kind of liberation.  
  
(8) 0 Lord Damodara, I first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly effulgent rope which binds Your belly.  
I then offer my obeisances to Your belly, which is the abode of the entire universe. I humbly bow down to

I continue it for a few days, in these days, my entire day remains well managed and disciplined. But I personally can't find any real devotion or meaning in doing naama japa. I meditate much better when I sit silently and observe my breath. I experience peace as well, this way. Plus I am much more inclined towards advaita and the idea of god being inside us and formless. So, imagining the deity and doing their naama japa doesn't sit right with me. It's very superficial to me and I know it deep inside.

I am not trying to disrespect any practise or deity, I am just trying to convey my situation.

But the thing is, even though it doesn't feel right doing these japaas, once I do them, I manage to get myself into a routine, for eg: just the idea that I have to do this many malas today, makes me disciplined and I can do my other tasks with ease. It improves my mental health, but since I don't feel much devotion or meaning, I stop the practise and then my discipline also breaks.

But Krishna is different. I feel a connection with him, I don't do any pooja or chant his mantras. But I feel, he was an enlightened person, just like us, and when I read more about him, I find myself aligning with his thought process more and more. I just want to say that I don't see him as an external god, but more like a realised person and I like how he doesn't force us to do any ritual or any practise. I can't explain, I just find myself aligning more with him spiritually and philosophically. I don't find any philosophical reasoning in mantra jaapa, that's why I see it as a chore.

I like meditating silently, but since, meditation doesn't have any concrete target like naama japa, where you can set a goal of doing x amount of malas, it is harder to do it daily. But I can't accept other things.

So as you can see I am quite confused and looking for some guidance. I don't find devotion while doing naama japa, I like meditating, but can't do it daily for more than a few days. If I don't do any spiritual practise daily, I give in to my procastinations and addictions (mainly social media and internet related) and my mental health worsens.",5,True,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living,,0.81,False,Morality/Ethics/Daily Living

in one form, he holds two lotus flowers and the other hands perform the varadamudra and the abhayamudra (boon and refuge mudras).

in the other form, he holds a lotus flower, a golden chakra, a conch shell and a mace.

According to the Hindu scripture, what does each item (chakra, conch, mace, lotus) represents?

The chakra and conch are Vishnu's symbols, however Surya and Vishnu are different (well, at least in modern Hinduism) and the symbolism of each item can be different.

Also, the Hindu epics mention the ""Suryaastra"" which is Surya's weapon. is this the mace he holds, or a differnt weapon?

Most Hindus I know in real life would say that they are monotheist (my circle may not be representative of the general population), but monotheism seems to be a rather uncommon opinion on this sub.

I would categorize myself as a monotheist in that God/Ishvar/Parmeshwar/Parmatma is one. There may be many gods/devtas but at the end of the day, they are all just emanations of the one God/Parmatma.

Does anyone else hold similar views?

Now their new reality would be thinking Hinduism might be wrong.

Same if some Buddhist dies and gets reincarnated into a Hindu or Jain house. Now they might think that Buddhism is a wrong/misguided path.

Jains don't eat meat but Buddhists do—does it mean that whatever sacrifices they made in last birth are now meaningless?

To what degree calling them meaningless is justified?

Even if we say that somehow they might get some inspiration to change the faith they were born into and convert to some other faith, do we have a for-sure answer that the faith they choose to convert is the correct one?

What justification do we have, and what basis do we have to judge other faiths as right or wrong?

If the answer is nothing, then what is stopping us from following the customs, practices, and rituals of other faiths as well?

What is stopping a Jain from eating meat or a Buddhist from praying to Hindu gods?

And why limit it to Indian faiths only why not include religions like Druze or Pythagoreanism, and Platonism?

Why not behave like their followers do?

If you say that we follow and respect their gods as well but don't behave like others do then it's just cherry-picking!!

My name is Jaxx. I am a college student in the USA. I am majoring in psychology. Currently, I am taking an Intro to Psych class, which the class is based on a research project that me and my groupmates conducted. 

Our topic is the impact of religion on someone's overall happiness. The survey is completely anonymous; nobody will know what you answered. The questions include topics such as your personal religious affliation, how often you partake in activities, and how happy you feel. 

I'm posting here because I need a little more variety in my outreach for this survey. Throughout my postings, and hopefully whatever my groupmates are doing, we have not gathered many answers from Buddhist people. You can see in my account posts I have posted this to a few subreddits where it pertains, but unfortunately I just haven't had the outreach i need for certain demographics. 

Before you take this survey, I want to apologize for one of the questions. We are not in a relgion class, we are simply studying thr impacts of faith on happiness and life satisfaction. With this being said, nobody in my group knew that pagan and Wiccan are vastly different faiths. We went with what we see in media and other surveys, which was wrong. Unfortunately, once the survey is published, we cannot change this. I am sorry for the misrepresentation. Nonetheless, I hope you are still willing to take the survey. 

Thank you in advance, and I hope you allow this to be posted SO can gather my data 💜

I asked if it would be okay, and two of them said yes, but the third one mentioned that only family can give gifts during Diwali.

I had already bought three gifts, which are small idols of Lord Ganesh, as one of my friends mentioned it would be a suitable choice. However, I’ve recently learned that gifting idols during Diwali might be considered inappropriate or frowned upon.

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do. Should I keep the gifts or look for alternatives? What would be more suitable to give during this time? I want to be respectful of their customs and traditions.

I apologise if this post breaks any rules, I will delete the post if necessary. This is also a throwaway account. I’m also sorry for the long post. 

So I (20F) am a part of a Hindu Brahmin family. Everyone in my family, especially my parents seem so connected to the Gods. I used to have that connection before, when I was around 16/17, but then it just disappeared. I have no idea why. And I don’t like it. 

I feel nothing when I enter the Pooja room at home. Like even when I light the lamp and do all the alankaras for the Gods, I feel nothing. It’s like doing a daily chore. In fact, I feel an aversion. Like even when I go to the temple I feel very … ""oh do I really have to go?"". I don’t like that I feel this way, it feels so wrong but I don’t know what to do. 

Even when I go to the temples, my mom tells me to look at the God’s eyes and say any Shloka. I do that, but I feel nothing. I feel no Bhakti. No connection. It feels wrong to be in the temple. 

My mom is a Shloka teacher and my dad goes for Veda lessons. So they’re quite religious and feel connected to the Gods, but there’s me, with no connection. 

I feel so guilty and sad and I don’t want to be this way. I want to go back to my old self. 

How do I feel more connected? How do I get Bhakti? I would appreciate some advice for this. 

Thank you very much.

I go to the Ganesha murti and think about how he snapped off his own tusk to keep his promise to Vyasa to keep writing the Mahabharata. I use it as an example of how I should keep my promises.



I see the Rama murti and remember he’s the exemplar of Dharma and how I need to be more like him to uphold Dharma in my own life.



The murti of Devi, the mother goddess makes me realize I need to appreciate my mother more and all she’s done for me.



Shiva’s murti encourages me to keep practicing Raja yoga for the benefit of both myself and others.

# Key Points to remember from Bhagavad Gita Chapter 8:

**The Nature of Reality and the Soul**

* **Brahman** is the ultimate reality, the supreme being that pervades everything.
* **Atman (Adhyatma):** The individual soul, a part of Brahman. Eternal, indestructible, divine. Appears separate, but ultimately identical to Brahman.
* **Karma** is the law of cause and effect that shapes our destiny.

**The Divine and the Material**

* **The Material Realm (Adhibhuta)** is the realm of the senses.
* **The Divine Realm (Adhidaiva)** is the universal form of the Lord, encompassing all demigods and representing the divine aspect of reality.
* **The Supreme Being (Adhiyajna)** is the ultimate source of creation and the controller of all beings (Lord of all sacrifices). 

**The Path to Liberation**

* **Remember God** at the time of death to attain liberation.
* **The Supreme Divine Personality** is the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.
* **Om** is the sacred syllable associated with liberation.
* **The path to liberation** involves restraining the senses, focusing the mind on the heart, and drawing the life breath to the head.
* **The Supreme Abode** is the ultimate goal, beyond the cycle of birth and death.

**The Two Paths**

* **The path of light** leads to liberation.
* **The path of darkness** leads to rebirth.

**The Cosmic Cycle**

* **Brahma's day and night** each last for a thousand cycles of the four ages.
* **Creation and destruction:** All beings arise and perish within this cosmic cycle.
* **The eternal dimension:** Beyond this cycle is the eternal Supreme Abode.

**Key Points for Everyday Life**

* **The Power of Devotion:** Unwavering devotion to the Supreme Divine Personality is the key to attaining liberation.
* **Mind Control:** Restraining the senses and focusing the mind on the heart are crucial for spiritual progress.
* **Karma:** Selfless service and dedication to duty are essential for positive karma.
* **Cosmic Perspective:** Understanding the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction can provide a sense of perspective and detachment from worldly affairs.
* **The Supreme Abode:** The Supreme Abode is the ultimate goal beyond the cycle of birth and death.
* **The Two Paths:** Understanding the two paths of light and darkness is essential for making informed choices in life.
* **Understanding the Two Paths:** Those who understand the two paths of liberation and rebirth are never confused.
* **The Importance of Devotion:** Remaining steadfast in devotion to the Supreme Divine Personality is crucial for attaining the Supreme Abode.
* **The Superiority of Devotion:** Devotion surpasses the benefits of Vedic rituals, study of the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, and charities.

By incorporating these key points into daily life, individuals can strive towards spiritual enlightenment and a more fulfilling existence.

Time is described differently across realms, like in Pitralok where 15 human days make one day, or in Brahmalok, where a single day lasts billions of human years. This intricate understanding aligns with modern ideas of time dilation, showcasing how ancient texts combined spiritual insights with scientific thought. Discover the details and read more here..

The examples he gave were of Shiva and Agni regarding beastiality with a parrot. I corrected him saying that as parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech, thus, the bird in this context serves as a symbol of the spread of divine wisdom, rather than representing any form of inappropriate or sexual interactions. In certain retellings, the bird becomes a symbol of transmitting sacred knowledge and represents how divine wisdom can be passed through different mediums.

Another example he said was of King Pandu from the Hindu epic Mahabharata having relations with a deer. I corrected him saying that the deer in the story were actually a human couple, a sage (Reshi) named Kindama and his wife. They transformed using ""magic"" into deer to be intimate in the forest. Whether that transformation actually involved them physically turning into animals or was simply a magic cloak to impair so others perceived them as animals is up to interpretation, but regardless they were both animals, and I'm not sure if that counts as bestiality. Pandu killed the male deer in their intimacy and the sage reveals his true form before dying and curse Pandu, which was he will also die if he has sex.  

And then he shows an image of statues or sculptures outside temple walls depicting the act of bestiality. I say such depictions in temple art is not an endorsement of the practices. Instead, these images are often interpreted as part of a larger symbolic framework that addresses human desires, spiritual transcendence, and the holistic portrayal of life. Some interpretations suggest that the outer walls represent the world of maya (illusion) and worldly desires, which the devotee must leave behind when entering the temple's sacred space. Some scholars suggest that these carvings were meant to display the range of human behaviors—good, bad, and neutral—as a reflection of the human condition. This includes even taboo acts, not as an endorsement but to illustrate the breadth of human actions and the moral choices one must make.

His very last claim is the most bold and he states that many parts of Hinduism still allow bestiality on certain animals. That's a very bold claim and I'm quite unsure he should make such statement. So I ask the experts here, does such claim hold any factual truth? 

Note I do not believe his intentions were to slander Hinduism but to provide examples that such instances are common within the mythology of different cultures. ",2,True,Question - General,,1.0,False,Question - General

1g511ol,"God helps on those who suffer, that's why true devotees are sad because God is giving them the ultimate happiness which others won't get. So if u are sad, thank God for it, and ask more and more sadness so that ur Bhakti in God becomes stronger and stronger.",av457av,2024-10-16 15:43:17+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g511ol/god_helps_on_those_who_suffer_thats_why_true/,4,/r/hinduism/comments/1g511ol/god_helps_on_those_who_suffer_thats_why_true/,hinduism,"Do you often feel like the more you worship, the more conflicts and suffering come to you. Do you see how the greatest devotees of God had to suffer so much sadness like Meera Bai and Prahlad.          
      
       
But God only gives sadness to devotees, so that they keep remembering God. See God is beyond good and evil. There is no wrong or right for Para Brahman. What you see as suffering is all viels of Maya, which you are allowing to fool you, just like how clouds cover the Sun.       
      
      
It is your fault, you were the one who did bad Karma, but God is beyond good and bad. God cannot differentiate between a righteous person who does good karma all the time, and between a evil person who does wrong all the time. God is ocean of mercy, and everyone is equal for God. People suffer because of their own mistakes and bad karma, ultimately it is some sort of Prarabdha, Sanchita, or Vartamaana bad Karma which is hindering you. You have lust, anger, envy, jealousy, greed, theft, and deceit in you, and no matter how much you keep doing good, you ultimately have selfish ends. Unless you give up your selfishness, God will never help you.       
      
       
All of this is caused by Ahankaara and Maya. You are verily Para Brahman, but you forgot it due to Ahankaara (ego) and Maya. And it is your fault, because you shouldn't have come in this world.       
      
        
So as soon as you meditate and give up ego, you will realise Paramatma. You will realise your true self. For that you must read and remember the 4 Vedas, and if you do not learn them by heart, then you are not a devotee and you cannot achieve Brahman.      
      
        
So whenever you feel why is your life so sad, then thank God for that. Bali bowed down to God, and he was burried down in Paatala Loka, then he became a donkey and suffered much sorrow. But you see, ultimately Bali was blessed to become the next Indra. So sorrows are nothing, they are Maya, and technically do not exist. Sadness is only trying to hide you from the real happiness, which God is waiting for you to get. So trust in God. And ask that your sadness never go away, ask so much sadness that you get desensitised towards it. God can also give you happiness, because if good and bad are same for God, then can God not give you happiness to come closer to God? But the problem there is, when God gives you happiness, you are the one who forget God and become indulged in worldy pleasures and wealth.          
          
           
So ask for sadness, poverty, affliction, conflicts and mental turmoil in your life, so that you can positively be immersed in Bhakti of God. Remember, God is hungry for you Bhaavas (feelings), this is why Shabari got Darshan of God and not the sages. Because the Sages who taught us the path of Gods, who showed us the correct way of a healthy, prosperous, pleasurable and spiritual life to connect with God, were driven by Ego Ahankara which covered them in Maya. This is why only true devotees who went through so much failures and sadness, only they were able to achieve God, because God sees only your feelings, everything else is just adambar (false show off). So be true to yourself, and always blame yourself, and purify yourself so that you reach God who is sitting above all the worlds, present everywhere within it, yet also away from it above all.",7,True,Other,,0.67,False,Other

1g4k0d7,Understanding the Nature of Detachment as Mentioned in Hindu Shastras,HeyBroWhatisUp,2024-10-15 23:16:02+01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/1g4k0d7/understanding_the_nature_of_detachment_as/,4,/r/hinduism/comments/1g4k0d7/understanding_the_nature_of_detachment_as/,hinduism,"Through the words of sages and scriptures, it's been understood that the path to God and enlightenment comes through detachment of wordily things. Now attachments to elements like beauty, wealth, and status can be well understood under the prospectus of this philosophy. One does not need these things to find fulfillment.  Obsessions over these material things is immature and undermines the greater purpose of our lives. 

Now, what I struggle to understand is the human component of attachment, our attachment to others, to our loved ones. Through their love and compassion, we have felt the presence of the divine. If we were born in a dark empty cave with no one around, we would not know the definition of love. But it is due to these individuals in our life we were able to learn and experience unconditional love, and formulate an idea of what God is like. Now does detachment mean to sever our relationships with them, put an end to this bond in which Krishna himself resides? 

Now, the answers I've heard have been nuanced, but most say that you do not forfeit your love, just your attachment. Without attachment, love them and perform your duties, as a child, husband, father, whatever it may be. But without attachment, can that love still be special, or does it dilute to becoming a generic love that we have for all people? Dharma is simply about doing what needs to be done while in the role we are playing. If I am married, it is my dharma to carry out my responsibilities as a husband, regardless of who my wife is. If I was detached, I will love her as she is part of the divine just like everyone else and that she is my wife. But if I was attached, I will love her for who she is, and no one can take her spot. She is my soulmate, and her and her alone in my life, can bring me joy. Her love for me and my love for her is special and holy. Its more than just the love I have for everyone else. It's special, pure, and unique to our bond. 

Now I know this is attachment, and according to common thought, this distracts you from God. But this is a complex element of life that not even Lord Rama could escape. When we needed to relinquish the throne, he did so without second thought. Material things did not matter to him. But when Laxman was injured by Indrajit, even Lord Rama came to tears.

It might be possible to let go of attachment, live life as a sanyasi or in sansara devoid of heartfelt relationships. When there is nothing to lose, one does not feel sorrow nor grief. But while in this form one tries to come closer to the divine, it still feels lacking. There feels to be something godly in those attachments we had, something pure and heartfelt. And when we suffer loss, its extraordinarily painful, but there is something sweet where we wouldn't have it any other way. Its similar to truth. Truth can hurt and cause pain, but its far better than living without it. Similarly, attachment to others might bring suffering, buts it feels better than living without it. 

Now, I know you might be thinking that my feelings contradict scripture, that I still have not found God, or have not understood the true nature of God. Nevertheless, I have felt his presence in the timeless bonds I have with others. In the joys of life, he's been present, but in the sorrows too, he has been present.

I've been practicing their religion by myself such as having a status of God ""Radha-Krisna"" in my room & a pamphlet of goddess of knowledge ""Swaraswati"" in my university dorm room, going to temple when I get the time ,fating & all..
I've graduated from a prestigious university & currently undergoing post graduate studies & soon I'll be hunting for a job.
Before joining any jobs & starting my life I'd like to convert into Hinduism.
I mean really convert. 
Like changing my name into an actual Hindu name & do the retual called ""Satya-joggo""/""Suddhi-joggo"".
I've already been talking with one of the Hindu lawyer & he's trying his best to do so but as we all know Bangladesh is not a safe place for Hindus & our political & religious instability is beyond hope. So I'm finding it very difficult. & The question of conversion is like a taboo here. There are many extremist groups who would even threaten me to death if I come out publicly saying I want to convert into Hinduism.
Ik the risks & all but still I want to do it.
I gave up my soul & denotation to the True religion of Sanatana.To Durga maa To RadhaKrishna.Soon I've been practicing in the dark alone.i want to live & die as a true hindu.i want to have an identity as one too. I want to partake in all the puja & rituals as one.so that even if anybody ask me about my document or id I could show them & say as a proud devotee ""I'm a Hindu I may not be born into this but I found it & I'm going to follow it till the day I spend my last bit of breath"" 
Because when I visit the temples & the pujas like Durga puja I feel so scared & insecure what if they find out I'm not a Hindu by birth & what if the think of me as an agent of extremist party trying to infiltrate their holy retual & destroying peace...(too many horrid incidents have occurred here in my country ,too many extremist party.it's a shame how minority is treated even in an independent country)

Ik all the risks & all the criticism that might come in my coming years..but I still am determined to do so.i want to die as an Hindu.get proper funeral the cleansing of fire.& Everything.

Before that
I've a few questions like if I get converted in Hinduism which group I'll be. Ik that there are 4 groups(Varna) in Hinduism (Brahmins,Kshatriyas,Vaishyas,Shudras)...also will I be eligible for a proper funeral. & Will the gods accept me as a servant of them both in my lifetime & after death. & If I ever want to get married will I be able to marry a devotee of Hinduism or will I have to marry someone who is also a convert like me? I don't care about the extremist society I'd live amongest the Hindu neighborhood & raise my family & children as one too. But will they accept me ? 
Ik my future kids might get into many problems in schools & other institutions throughout their lives for me & my name. I don't want them to suffer that's why I've already tried my lawyer to change my National ID cards name & all of my academic certificates name but it's a lengthy process & too much drawing attention to self. It could destroy my family (my mother & 2 sisters ) reputation & all moreover threats from the extremist society ... 

That's why I've planned to post it here...I don't to change my religion & do the necessary retuals before getting into any jobs ... I want to do it under my new name (if possible).if not I'd like to keep my birth name in my certificates & NID but have the necessary documents to live as a peace loving Hindu & follow all the rituals & do all the fasting in akadoshis & all ... 

Plz give some suggestions... Also if anyone's from Bangladesh plz help me if you could...

I don't have the age to be asked for adoption by any Hindu family who doesn't have any kids or such .. I don't even have the financial ability to move into another country such as India or abroad so I could freely follow My desired religion... I was born into Bangladesh & born in a family which was not Hindu.. it's not my fault... But dying as one who is not Hindu seems a waste of my life... & I can't take it ... 
So I with my sound mind & clear consciousness I want to convert ... 

Plz help me ... I beg of you all",7,True,Question - Beginner,,1.0,False,Question - Beginner

The entire ritual is based on  the story of Rishi sunashepa who was saved from a human sacrifice by the intervention of varuna.  Not even the pali canon has statements denouncing vedas for human sacrifices, they only talked about animal sacrifices.

> 12. By means of the Puruṣa Nārāyaṇa (litany), the Brahman priest (seated) to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the stakes) with this sixteen-versed (hymn, Ṛg-v. X, 90, Vāj. S. XXXI, 1-16), 'The thousand-headed Puruṣa, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed[7] . . .;'--thus (he does) for the obtainment and the securing of everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Puruṣamedha is everything: in thus saying, 'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and thereby indeed magnifies him (Puruṣa); but he also thereby speaks of him, such as he is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they were not yet slaughtered,--
13. Then a voice[8] said to him, **'Puruṣa, do not consummate (these human victims[9]): if thou wert to consummate them, man (puruṣa) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried round them, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same divinities[10], and thereby gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him with all objects of desire.**
14. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with fiery mettle he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.


If tantra had human sacrifices it was against vedic sanction and should be seen as a transgressive heteropraxy.

https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-english/d/doc63525.html



**What exactly is the purushamedha**

The purushamedha ritual is the ritual through which the sacrificer gives up all worldly possessions and becomes a renunciate/forest hermit. This ritual is where the purusha sukta is used.


> And if a Brāhmaṇa performs the sacrifice, he should bestow all his property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brāhmaṇa is everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Puruṣamedha is everything.

> 20. And having taken up the two fires within his own self[13], and worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa (litany, viz. Vāj. S. XXXI, 17-22), let him betake himself to the forest without looking round; and that (place), indeed, is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village, let him take up again the two fires

This stems from the unspoken vedic idea of ritualizing/seeing reversible(cyclic?) yajnas appearing in the world processes(yajna also stands for all processes that maintain the world - please refer gita's  karma chapters to know more). The causal sequence of world manifestation in the purusha sukta is Purusha Narayana -> Viraj -> (Purusha) Everything.

So by giving up everything that he possesses(and external forms of rituals)  he can obtain the purusha(which is everything) or atleast begin his journey through jnana marga.

Hence purushamedha can be read as sacrificing(medha) your worldly self(purusha) and also as bringing to one's intellect(medha) the inner self(purusha narayana).  So much for a ritual wrongly portrayed as a human sacrifice to obtain worldy benefits.

This end goal also sheds some theological light into the  sunashepa katha from which the ritual seems to have been inspired. Sunashepa was freed by Varuna from his bonds chaining him to the sacrificial altar/ritual(possibly a symbol for the worldy life) when he created rks literally becoming a rishi aka *seer of Brahman*.",12,True,Refutation,,0.95,False,Refutation

I’ve been following Sadhguru’s Isha Yoga path for 6 years, which I believe aligns with the Ashtanga Patanjali Sutras. I dedicate 2-3 hours daily to asanas and pranayama, and for the last 2 years, I’ve been practicing Samyama. After completing my Navratri Sadhana this October, I’ve felt a deep calling toward Devi Sadhana or Shakti Sadhana, alongside my existing Shiva-focused practices.

During the recent Navratri, I performed 3 days of Kali, 3 days of Lakshmi, and 3 days of Saraswati, I sense a specific calling towards individual Devis, and I’m trying to understand how to honor that.

I know there are four Navratris in the year, but I’m only familiar with the one that just happened in October. I’m wondering:

* Which Devi (Kali, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, etc.) to invoke on specific moon days?
* What mantras (without beej mantras) can be used for these sadhanas?
* Should I continue focusing on Linga Bhairavi Sadhana, or explore individual Devi Sadhanas as well?

I’m posting this on r/Tantrasadhaks, r/Tantra, r/Hinduism, r/Shaktism, and r/Shakti to gather insights from different practitioners and traditions. Any guidance or resources that could help deepen my understanding and practice would be greatly appreciated.

One guy on his forum said, ""Enlightened people don't need this concept called Kṛṣṇa."" Many enlightened sages worshipped Kṛṣṇa. Sage Parāṣara called Lord Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān. Kṛṣṇa is not just a concept people believe in. He is reality.

Thought that since the temple is so close on Mondays I will go there and do my jaap as well as offer water and milk to the shivling. However I have visited the temple 3 times now and each time there had been some issue -
1. First time I went late in the evening and while I was praying a rat walked very close to my feet and I was startled since my eyes were closed 
2. Second time I went early in the morning I saw some big ants but still continued my prayers when I was done they had bitten me all over my leg and it was quite painful that day
3. And when I visited the temple early morning today I was feeling unnecessaryily hot like it wasn't that hot while I was walking there but in the temple I felt very breathless. 

I know the first 2 especially could just be coincidence but from today I can't help but feel like there is either some weird energy in the temple or shiv ji is angry with me. Though at home I have never had any issues always feel at peace whenever I complete my jaap.

By tradition of course we have a Kuladevi. We worship her during Navratri and sometimes during other ocassions. I have always been curious abt Shakta traditions. I come from Maharashtra where there are strong pockets of Devi devotion. I am somehow more aware of Vaishnava and Shaiva culture, texts and traditions than Shakta. 

Few questions 

1) Primary texts related to Shakta?
2) Does Shakta have to involve learning Tantra (I know even daily puja is Tantra but what I mean is Advanced Tantra)
3) Like Iskcon is for Vaishnavas or Isha or Lingayats are for Shaiva (I also know many ppl dont like them here on this forum), why is there no major organisation for promoting Shakta/Devi worship globally? 
4) Can one achieve moksha by Devi Bhakti alone? 
5) Just like Aum Namah Shivay or Aum Namo Narayana, what is the basic key mantra for Shakta tradtions?

1.Nearly all scriptures, their commentaries from various sages/schools of thoughts ,explanations and many other references are freely available

2.Lots of perspectives,schools of thoughts and philosophy can be easily explored, summarized and evaluated effieciently.

3.In-depth and step by step meditation and other techniques from various cultures,traditions and personal discoveries

**Now these are the breathtaking ones that are recently possible in easiest way:**

1.Ability to create one's own school of thoughts:

Utilizing AI in order to input our fundamental thoughts, and creation of its application,expansion as well as revision on every aspect of life using various scriptures from upanishads,puranas or other texts as base. Just like many texts originated taking aspects of vedas as base, we can create many aspects using scriptures as base. For example, i explored about river and philosophy and meditation of river to explain each part of life and universe.Creation of sanskrit mantras, knowledge about aspect of reality and practical worship/meditation can be generated using references from thousands of other sages's knowledge

2.Ability to create images and videos of ishvara for bhakti:

To be able to input any quality,attribute and create a diety residing on cosmos or river or hill or any way one wishes is revolutionizing as it assists in personalizing the meditation and visualization. If you wish to worship krishna as friend, a father or even a teacher, you can make it . If you want to worship durga mata as a child , you can create image and worship. If you want to create an image of shiva on cosmic background , dancing with destruction, you can create it as well and worship that form. 

3.Ability to create own songs:

Currently, we can even create songs to invoke awareness or devotion , that is beautiful and can exactly replicate one's current stage . I tried creating isha upanishad song  and another sanskrit song, and i can feel bliss and progress in bhakti more deeply than if i simply contemplated lines, since bhajans and kirtan can be created for one's favourite diety and scriputure. Any way , many many methods and paths are now available.

Its so interesting to compare the base opinion I grew up with of ""she was evil"" with the much more nuanced view of her I developed after reading valmiki ramayan. There's just the perfect amount of information to base a novel off of on: warrior princess, grew up amongst brothers, a tinge of mythicism with her left hand being as hard as diamond, who's mother was thrown out by her own father, who thus developed a close bond with her nurse maid manthara, (which may justify how she was poisoned by her considering shes the only mother she has known), who eventually, perhaps stemming from the fear of seeing her own queen being thrown out by kaikeyis father, warned kaikeyi, that from her perspective, kaikeyi would be treated the same. The innocence of not knowing the exact rules of succession, the fear of being thrown out overtaking her love for ram, her head strong attitude, everything paints a tragic and beautiful story that can be written with her inner voice. Coupled with my love for ramayan the legend of Prince Ram, i wanted to write a book on her. Then i discovered that was already done by Vaishnavi Patel, being exactly what I had in mind. I was a bit heartbroken I must admit, but I mean, good for her, its a brilliant book. The question remains, my fellow gen z Hindus, or lovers of retellings of mythology, just  what's that one character you want explored, who you want to see an itihasa from the perspective of- or can I still write something on kaikeyi...

First of all, I'd like to make it clear that I've not read any scriptures or texts. My question is, after seeing so many cartoons, series, and films on the life of Lord Krishn, I've noticed that in many adaptations, Nand helped Vasudev by keeping Krishn and exchanging his daughter Yogmaya with him. Other adaptations show that Vasudev secretly placed Krishn in the crib of Nand and Yashoda's daughter and took their daughter with him.

I'd like to clear up my doubts about what actually occurred. Did Nand already know about Krishn's truth? If so, why would he agree to exchange his child for Vasudev's? That's weird to me.

It usually lasts for 15 days and celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the  demon Mahishasura, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.

Dashain celebrations involve several specific rituals that hold great significance. Here are some of the key rituals:

1. Ghatasthapana: This marks the beginning of Dashain. A sacred pot (ghata) is placed in a designated area, usually in a temple or home, and filled with holy water. Barley seeds are sown around it to grow jamara, which symbolizes prosperity.

2. Worship of Durga: For the first nine days, devotees worship the goddess Durga through various rituals and offerings, including prayers, flowers, and food.

3. Nawami : On the ninth day, Some people offers Animal, as a way to appease the goddess. With Changing time, most of the people especially in city area started offering Ash Guord (Kubhindo) in place of animals.

4. Dashami Tika: On the tenth day, which is the main day of Dashain, elders give tika ( mixture of rice,yogurt & cinnaba) and jamara to younger family members, blessing them for health, prosperity, and success. They prepare special dishes & sweets & Visits important relatives house to put tika.This is a time for family gatherings and celebrations.

These rituals not only honor the goddess but also strengthen family bonds and cultural traditions during the festival. ",2,False,Hindū Rituals & Saṃskāras (Rites),,0.99,False,Hindū Rituals & Saṃskāras (Rites)

Continued from the previous part..................

***13. “The great souls who have attained Me, never take rebirth in this temporary and suffering world, as they have achieved the highest perfection.”***

***- Verse 8.15***

***14. “Arjuna, you will be reborn in all the worlds up to the abode of Brahma, but on reaching My abode there is no rebirth.”***

***- Verse 8.16***

***15. “A day of Brahma is as long as a thousand cycles of the four ages. His night is also the same length. Those who understand this understand the true nature of day and night.”***

***- Verse 8.17***

***16. “At the beginning of each Brahma's day, countless beings are born. At the end of Brahma's night, they are destroyed, only to be reborn at the beginning of the next day.”***

***- Verse 8.19***

***17. “Beyond this manifested and unmanifested world, there exists an eternal unmanifest realm which is not destroyed even when everything else is destroyed.”***

***- Verse 8.20***

***18. “The eternal, unmanifest realm is the ultimate destination. Once reached, there is no return to this world. This is My supreme abode.”***

***- Verse 8.21***

***19. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the greatest of all, can only be known through unwavering devotion. He is all-pervading in nature and all beings are situated within Him.”***

***- Verse 8.22***

***20. “I will now explain the different times (paths) at which a yogi never returns and also returns during that time of departing (from this world), O Best of Bharatas.”***

***- Verse 8.23***

***21. “By following the path of fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of sun's northern journey, those who know the Brahman, attains Brahman.”***

***- Verse 8.24***

The verse describes the auspicious conditions for attaining Brahman, the Supreme Divine:

* **""By following the path of fire"":** This refers to performing Vedic rituals and sacrifices, which are often associated with fire.
* **""light"":** This refers to the bright part of the day, as opposed to the dark part of the night.
* **""daytime"":** This indicates that the departure should occur during the day, not at night.
* **""the bright fortnight"":** This refers to the waxing phase of the moon, which is considered auspicious.
* **""the six months of the sun's northern course"":** This refers to the period when the sun is traveling northward in the sky, which is considered auspicious for spiritual practices.
* **""those who know the Brahman"":** This refers to individuals who have a deep understanding and realization of the Supreme Being.

If a person who knows Brahman departs from this world **during these auspicious times**, **they attain Brahman, the ultimate goal of spiritual liberation.**

***22. “The yogi who departs from this world during the smoke (twilight period), night-time, the dark fortnight, and the six months when the sun travels southward attain the moon, the lunar light but will eventually return to Earth.”***

***- Verse 8.25***

The verse describes the fate of individuals who practice Vedic rituals and depart from this world during inauspicious times:

**The smoke:** This refers to the twilight period, which is considered inauspicious.

**Night-time:** Nighttime is generally considered less auspicious than daytime for spiritual pursuits.

**The dark fortnight of the moon:** The waning phase of the moon is believed to be less conducive to spiritual progress.

**The six months when the sun travels southward:** This refers to the southern course of the sun, which is considered less auspicious than the northern course.

**Attaining the moon:** Those who depart during these inauspicious times are said to attain the moon, which is considered a celestial abode or heavenly realm.

**Returning to Earth:** Despite attaining the celestial abodes, they will eventually return to Earth. This suggests that the happiness and rewards obtained in the celestial realms are temporary and do not lead to eternal liberation.

Overall, the above two verses emphasize that the timing of one's departure from this world can significantly influence their afterlife. Those who depart during auspicious times are more likely to attain liberation, while those who depart during inauspicious times may experience temporary happiness in the celestial abodes but will ultimately return to Earth.

***23. “The path of light and the path of darkness are eternal for the world. By the one (the path of light), one does not return (rebirth), by the other (the path of darkness), one returns again.”***

***- Verse 8.26***

**The two paths:** The above are the two paths for departing from this world.

**The path of light:** This path leads to **liberation** and does not result in rebirth.

**The path of darkness:** This path leads to **rebirth**, and those who follow it will eventually return to the material world.

***24. “Those yogis who understand these two paths are never confused. Therefore, always remain in Yog, O Arjuna.”***

***- Verse 8.27***

**Understanding of the two paths:** Those who understand the paths of light and darkness are not confused. This implies that having knowledge of the different paths leading to liberation and rebirth is essential for avoiding spiritual confusion.

**Remaining in Yog:** The advice to ""always remain in Yog"" underscores the significance of maintaining a state of **union with God**. Yogic practices, such as *meditation, breath control, ethical conduct and the overall firm devotion*, are essential for achieving and maintaining this state. 

Overall, the verse suggests that by understanding the two paths and practicing Yog, one can avoid spiritual confusion and attain liberation.

***25. “The fruit of the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities is mentioned. The yogi who knows this fact (the fact of the above two paths) gains beyond all these (the mentioned fruit) and attains the Supreme Abode.”***

***- Verse 8.28***

The verse highlights the contrast between the conventional spiritual practices and the path of devotion.

**Conventional Spiritual Practices:**

* **Study of the Vedas:** The Vedas are ancient Hindu scriptures that contain a vast body of knowledge about spiritual matters.
* **Performance of sacrifices:** Sacrifices are religious ceremonies involving the offering of various items to deities.
* **Austerities:** Austerities are self-imposed disciplines or hardships undertaken for spiritual purification.
* **Charities:** Giving to charity is considered a virtuous act.

**The Yogi's Path:**

* **Understanding the two paths:** The yogi who understands the true nature of the spiritual path recognizes that there are two paths to departure: **the path of light and the path of darkness.**
* **Gaining beyond all these:** The yogi who follows the path of light, which involves devotion to the Supreme Being, achieves a higher level of spiritual attainment than those who merely engage in the conventional spiritual practices.
* **Attaining the Supreme Abode:** The ultimate goal of the yogi is to attain the Supreme Abode, which is the ultimate state of liberation.

In essence, the verse emphasizes that while conventional spiritual practices can yield certain benefits, the path of devotion to the Supreme Being is superior and leads to the ultimate goal of liberation.

When the cosmos was a void of darkness, a divine light manifested and took the form of Goddess Mahashakti. She then created the Trinity of Gods—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and guided them to meditate to understand their roles as creator, preserver, and destroyer. Pleased with their devotion, Mahashakti appeared as Siddhidhatri, bestowing upon the gods their consorts Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati respectively, to give them the power, the shakti, to carry out their duties.

In her iconography, Siddhidhatri is depicted seated on a lotus with four arms, holding a chakra (disc), shankha (conch), mace, and lotus. Her presence symbolizes the dispelling of ignorance and the bestowal of knowledge to realize the ultimate reality, Brahman.

Here's how each form can correspond to a woman's lifecycle: 

**NORTH INDIA-** 

1. **Shailaputri (Daughter of the Mountains)** – **Birth and Childhood**
   * Shailaputri represents the pure, innocent, and powerful spirit of a young girl. Just as she is the daughter of the Himalayas, a girl at this stage is seen as the embodiment of purity, potential, and the untainted beginning of life.
2. **\*\*Brahmacharini (The Ascetic)\*\* – \*\*Adolescence and Learning\*\***
   * This form signifies devotion, penance, and the pursuit of knowledge. During adolescence, a girl is often focused on learning, both academically and spiritually, discovering herself and the world. Brahmacharini symbolizes discipline, strength, and a commitment to growth.
3. **Chandraghanta (Warrior with a Crescent Moon) – Young Adulthood**
   * In this form, the goddess is a warrior, strong and ready to fight for justice. This stage represents a woman stepping into her own power, establishing her identity, and taking on the challenges of life with courage and determination.
4. **Kushmanda (The Creator of the Universe) – Creation and Nurturing**
   * Kushmanda is often associated with the creative energy that gives birth to life. This form reflects the nurturing aspect of a woman, often linked with motherhood or the creation of something new, whether it's giving birth to a child or fostering a creative project or career.
5. **Skandamata (Mother of Skanda) – Motherhood and Protection**
   * Skandamata, the mother of Skanda (Kartikeya), represents the protective and caring nature of a mother. This stage symbolizes a woman’s role as a nurturer and protector of her family, especially her children, emphasizing the fierce love and protection that a mother provides.
6. **Katyayani (The Warrior Goddess) – Strength and Leadership**
   * Katyayani represents a fierce warrior who embodies strength and courage. At this stage, a woman often takes on leadership roles, whether in her family, career, or community. She becomes a protector, guiding and supporting others while asserting her own power and independence.
7. **Kaalratri (The Fearsome Night) – Challenges and Transformation**
   * Kaalratri is the form of Durga that is dark, fierce, and protective, symbolizing the challenging phases of life. This stage in a woman's life reflects the trials, fears, and adversities she faces, but also her capacity to overcome them. It is a time of deep transformation and resilience.
8. **Mahagauri (The Radiant One) – Wisdom and Maturity**
   * Mahagauri represents purity, wisdom, and calm after overcoming challenges. As a woman grows older, she embodies a serene wisdom and inner radiance that comes from life experience, knowledge, and a deeper understanding of herself and the world around her.
9. **Siddhidhatri (The Granter of Boons) – Fulfillment and Legacy**
   * Siddhidhatri, the giver of boons, represents a woman in her later years who has achieved a sense of fulfillment and wisdom. This stage reflects a woman's role in passing on her knowledge, nurturing the next generation, and leaving behind a legacy of strength, love, and wisdom.

  
**SOUTH INDIA**

# 1. Durga (First Three Days) – Power and Protection

* **Durga** represents the **destructive** and **protective** aspects of the Goddess, who eliminates evil forces and restores righteousness. In South Indian traditions, these first three days are dedicated to **Kali, Bhadrakali, and Chamundeshwari**, among other fierce forms.
* **Kali** is the fierce protector and warrior who destroys evil forces like demons, symbolizing a woman's ability to face challenges fearlessly.
* **Bhadrakali** is a benevolent, protective form, symbolizing the destruction of ignorance.
* **Chamundeshwari** is the slayer of demons like Chanda and Munda, emphasizing the defeat of arrogance and negativity.

These forms are venerated for their ability to remove obstacles, protect from harm, and destroy negative forces in one's life.

# 2. Lakshmi (Second Three Days) – Wealth and Prosperity

* The next three days of Navaratri focus on **Goddess Lakshmi**, the embodiment of wealth, abundance, and well-being. In South India, these days emphasize the role of the Goddess in bringing **material and spiritual prosperity**.
* **Mahalakshmi** represents wealth, fortune, and fertility.
* **Gaja Lakshmi** is worshipped as the giver of prosperity, often shown with elephants as symbols of power and abundance.
* **Dhanalakshmi** bestows wealth and prosperity, both material and spiritual.

These days also symbolize the importance of hard work, growth, and the nurturing aspect of women, where they are seen as the source of prosperity and nurturing energy in the household and community.

# 3. Saraswati (Final Three Days) – Wisdom and Knowledge

* The final three days are dedicated to **Saraswati**, the Goddess of wisdom, learning, and the arts. In South India, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, **Saraswati Puja** is a major highlight, symbolizing the importance of acquiring knowledge and refining one’s skills.
* **Saraswati** is depicted as seated on a lotus or swan, holding a **veena**, representing music, knowledge, and wisdom.
* **Sharada** is another form of Saraswati, worshipped particularly in Karnataka, representing the purity of knowledge and learning.",1,True,History/Lecture/Knowledge,,0.79,False,History/Lecture/Knowledge

And I thought learning Śrī sūktam is customary. 

Now I cannot stop chanting it. I feel many things at once and it is overwhelming but I don't want it to stop. I feel absolutely loved, protected & secure. I feel every word of Śrī sūktam being engraved on my face permanently. I feel some weight on my head and it sometimes sends shivers down my body. I feel like having a personal & intimate conversation with the Goddess; as we normally speak to our most loved ones. I can feel her listening to my chants. I feel like I'm in a womb and there's no more of my existence. I feel like I'm a point (if that makes sense). I feel like I could touch & feel each word of Śrī sūktam & it satisfies my very being.

So here goes. 

I would like to create a community where we mostly learn about various theologies including our own and learn to respond to arguments by Christians, Muslims, and even Buddhists (less so but there are aggressive ones). Mainly because a lot of these people come very well trained and read in their scriptures as well as some of ours and many Hindus irl don't have deep answers to them. They say we follow it because it is cool etc but don't really understand the depth in their own traditions as well as the shortcomings in other ones (and maybe their own ideas) from a logical and argumentation standpoint. Now, I know we have a long tradition of discussion but most of those rely on the opponent having some sort of respect or familiarity with the Vedas as an authority. What I want to see is can we develop arguments for pantheism or panentheism or Dvaita from Western logic. Not to humiliate others, but to lay out our positions. So that people disconnected from such ideas understand, with lesser reliance on emotional/spiritual truths, even though they do bring many converts and are transformative.

Let me know if I'm stepping out of line or whether you would be interested in a Discord server or other medium for this. I would need mod help.

I have done much study myself but I'm a bit lonely so this seems great way to make friends but also contribute. I've never done anything like this before so I hope some people engage with this.",4,True,Question - General,,0.67,False,Question - General

Srinivasacharya regards Brahman as the universal soul, both transcendent and immanent, referred to by various names such as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Viṣnu, Vāsudeva, Purushottama, Nārāyaņa, Paramatman, Bhagawan and so on. Similarly, Nimbārkācārya, in his Vedanta Kamadhenu Daśaślokī, refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa alongside his consort Śrī Rādhā.﻿ 

Brahman is the supreme being, the source of all auspicious qualities, and possesses unfathomable attributes. ﻿He is omnipresent, omniscient, the lord of all, and greater than all. None can be equal to or superior to Brahman. 'ब्रह्म चाचिन्त्यानन्तनिरतिशयस्वाभाविकवृद्धत्तमस्वरूपगुणाद्याश्रयभूतः सर्वज्ञः सर्वशक्तिः सर्वेश्वरः सर्वकारणरूपः समानातिशयशून्यः सर्वव्यापकः सर्ववेदकैवेद्यः श्रीकृष्णएव बृहति बृंहयति तस्मादुच्यते परं ब्रह्म ।'

Brahman is possessed of two-fold characteristics; the śruti passages that refer to nirguṇa Brahman signify Brahman not having the faults of material modes of nature, while the śruti passages that refer to saguṇa Brahman signify Brahman having natural unfathomable auspicious qualities.
'निर्गुणवाक्यानां मायिकगुणनिषेषपरत्वेन सगुणवचनानां स्वाभाविकगुणप्रतिपादनपरत्वेन'

Brahman is the creator, cause of creation, maintenance and destruction of the world.
""सर्वशक्तिः सार्वज्यादिगुणवान् सर्वेश्वरः पुरुषोत्तम एव जगद्धेतुरिति निश्चेतुं शक्यते।""

It is Brahman from whom, the universe originates, on whom it subsists and in whom it finally merges. Here ‘origination’ means the expansion of the manifold consciousness of the sentient being, due to its connection with a body and the rest; and ‘dissolution’ means its entrance into the Cause (Brahman), resulting from the contraction of its consciousness. 'उक्तः अत्रचेतनस्यानादिनिधनस्य देहाविसंयोगहेतुकविचित्रविज्ञानविकाशो जन्म तत्संकोचपूर्वकः कारणप्रवेशः प्रलयः'

Brahman is both material and efficient cause of the world. 'तथाच जगदभिन्ननिमित्तोपादानत्वे सति सत्यत्वादिमत्त्वं ब्रह्मलत्तणंसिद्धम्।'

MATERIAL CAUSE(UPĀDĀNA)

Brahman is the material cause of the world in the sense of turning his natural powers known as Parā Śakti and Aparā Śakti, from the subtle form into the gross form which gave rise to various further effects, existent and inherent in them respectively. 'परापरादिशब्दाभिधेयानां स्वस्वाभाविकीनां सूक्ष्मावस्थापन्नानां शक्तीनां. तत्तद्‌गतसरूपकार्याणाञ्च स्थूलतयाप्रकाशकत्वमुपादानत्वम् ।'

Although these as a power, different from the possessor of powers, yet it is non-different from Brahman, because of having no existence and activity apart from the possessor.
'शक्तित्वेन शक्तिमतोभिन्ना।' शक्तिमत्पृथकूस्थितिप्रवृत्त्यभावाद्ब्रह्माऽभिन्ना ।' 

EFFICIENT CAUSE (NIMITTA)
Brahman functions as the efficient cause by facilitating the union of sentient beings, whose inherent knowledge remains in a state of profound contraction due to the enduring influence of their beginningless karmic impressions. This contracted state renders them incapable of recollecting the experiences they are destined to undergo in their current life. Through the manifestation of knowledge, Brahman enables them to become aware of and experience the results of their past karmas, along with the appropriate instruments for their fruition. स्वस्वानादिकर्मसंस्कारवशीभूतात्यन्तसङ्कुचितभोगस्मरणानईज्ञानधर्माणां चेतनानां कर्मफलभोगाईज्ञानप्रकाशनेन तत्तत्कम्र्मफलतत्तद्भोगसाधनैः सह
योजयितृत्वं निमित्तत्वम् ।

The explanation regarding the efficient cause is further simplified by Sri Purushottamacharya in Vedanta Ratna Manjusha. He explains that the Lord serves as the efficient cause by governing the destinies of individual souls with strict justice. During the cosmic dissolution, the impressions of past karmas become obscured and confused. However, at the time of creation, the Lord reawakens these impressions in each soul, ensuring that every individual undergoes the consequences of their previous actions.
'निमितत्वञ्च–स्वस्वानादिकम्र्मसंस्कारवशीभूतात्यन्तसंकुचितस्मृत्यनर्हज्ञानानां चेतनानां कर्मफलभोगाईज्ञानप्रकाशेन तत्तत्कर्मफलतत्तद्भोगसाधनैः सह संयोजयितृत्वम् ।'

CREATION

In the scriptures, Brahman is referred to as Āptakāma, meaning ""one whose desires are fully realized."" This raises the question: what purpose does Brahman, who lacks unfulfilled desires, have in creating the universe?

To address this, the Srinivasacharya refers to the concept of lila (divine play), as expounded by Bādarāyaṇa in the Brahma Sūtras, particularly the aphorism ""लोकवत्तु लीलाकैवल्यम् ॥"", which translates to ""creation is merely a sport for Brahman."" Here, the term lila denotes an activity performed spontaneously and joyfully, much like a playful act that requires no effort or intent. As described, lila is characterized as an effortless, joyful expression, unlike a deliberate, self-conscious exertion. In line with this idea, Srinivasacharya holds that the creation of the universe is a lila of Brahman—a natural and unmotivated expression of divine bliss.

This analogy is further illustrated by comparing Brahman to a sovereign king, who, despite having all his desires fulfilled, occasionally engages in playful activities purely out of exuberance and joy. Just as a person overflowing with happiness may dance or sing without any specific purpose, so too does Brahman create the universe as a spontaneous expression of bliss, without any underlying motive or goal.
'यथा खलु लोके प्राप्तैश्वर्यस्य सार्वभौमस्य फलसङ्कल्पं विनैव विचित्रमक्षकन्दुकादिभिर्विक्रीडनं लीलामात्रं दृश्यते, तथा ब्रह्मणोऽपि लीलाकैवल्यं, केवळं विश्वोत्पादनादिक्रीडामात्रमित्यर्थः ॥'

However, this leads to another question: if creation is a lila, does that imply it is devoid of any significance or guiding principle? In response, it is clarified that while creation is a lila, it is still governed by a sense of order and justice. Brahman creates the universe in such a way that beings may reap the consequences of their actions. Brahman remains impartial, akin to a cloud that pours rain equally everywhere; the variance in the crops is determined by the nature of the soil and seeds, not by the cloud itself.  'ब्रह्मणोहि देवादिरूपविषमजनोत्पादने विश्वसृष्टयादौ पर्जन्यस्य विषमाङ्करोत्पादनादौ तत्तद्दजिसापेक्षवत्त्ववत्तत्तत्कर्मसापेक्षत्वात् ।'

Another question that arises concerns the origin of the first creation: how was the nature of the first creation determined? The response is that creation is without any beginning and endless, and thus, the notion of a ""first"" creation is irrelevant in this context.

Thus ends the second part of the philosophy of srinivasa and nimbarka svabhavika bhedabheda. Please checkout part one also. ",10,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy),,0.99,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy)

We’ve hugged a few times, and recently she tried to kiss me, but I stopped her because I’m conflicted. On one hand, I enjoy her company, but on the other, I’m uncertain about the future and whether it’s ethically okay to engage in intimacy in a relationship that doesn’t seem to have a future.

As a practicing Hindu, I feel this is an important moral question, and I’m struggling to find clarity. How do I navigate this from a dharmic perspective? Is it wrong to get physically close with someone if I know the relationship is temporary?

The Hindu subcontinent  has seen thousands of grand temples which were made to cater the humans, reach their ultimate goal and also for various other purposes. Unfortunately we faced too many invasions and in North India the temple culture has taken quite a hit. But still there are many places which are still alive because of their nature of conscreations and because of yogis and priests who took care of them. For transformation and  seeking one has to take the help of energy space like this or someone has to take serious strides in yoga(particularly kriya yoga) because unless you go beyond the mind and body you will keep changing directions. Once you taste something of the beyond you cannot fool yourself for long. Somewhere u will know where the real deal is even if you change your direction and hence you will keep coming back to it. This directory maps key energy spaces which have been verified by a group of advanced meditators(led by a man from nepal who is a yogi) from Isha.What verification here would mean is that you not only experience the different aspects of enrgy body of your own systems(the nadis, chakrasetc.) but you also understand how the space is functioning. I know that Sadhguru and Isha are not welcomed in this group which is fine but some(almost 90%) of these places are not related to Isha at all. It is just that the mediators went there and clearly experienced energy spaces and listed them for the larger use of the public. This work took about 2-3years for the group. Enromous amount of effort which i cannot write  or explain here went in this work. This is a phenomenonal effort to locate temples and samadhis of yogis near you. Temples and energy spaces are not about going there touching the floor and coming back, you must sit there and close your eyes to imbibe the energy otherwise it is good for your insta profile that u visited some great temple but u will gain nothing. The website has not listed anything related to description of energy on the website because you may go with an assumption into the temple or space which is not what you want. You should go with an intrigue only then a possibility to experience will come. Unless we change our behavior towards our temples we will not progress neither as a community nor as a nation. What happened in tirmula temple is an indirect consequence of our ignorance towards our temples and ignorance towards our inner dimension. We must transform ourselves to revive sanatan dharma. Today i see  internet Hindus are like reactions to Abrahamic religions which is quite concerning. Let us transform ourselves and the rest will eventually take care by itself. Namaskar.

Then I got one more opportunity and just 1 month before exam I get chikungunya. 

I don't know what I did in my life or past life that warranted this. Most of my peers sail smoothly. My parents also blame me for their bad luck. I am a mangli. They organised a pooja for me. I don't know about astrology or stuff but some people's luck really makes me question my own life.

I tried counting my sins. I drank alcohol a few time, 2-3 times. I eat non veg and eggs. I smoke. I used to masturbate but I have stopped now since 1 month. I visit temple 2 times a week with sincerity. I try to be a good person.

How much selfishness is hidden in these words. You know that everyday thousands of people are going through unimaginable pain, they have lost so much. But still, only when that hardship strikes *you*, you feel bad and start to lose faith in God.

Praying to God, will not achieve anything on its own. Praying to God for selfish desires, even to think that those prayers will be heard is foolish. Is God some bank, where you go, deposit a request or loan and get money? Does God owe anything to you? Why, in any scenario, should he be indebted to you and give you as you please. The real thing which God wants you to do, is get up, and do your work yourself. Take control. But, do not turn egoistic doing so. It is not 'Leave everything to God and trust him to take control'. Nor is it 'Take control over my own decisions and act completely as you please.' It is 'Take control, and trust God to guide you on the right decision'.

I don't want moksha, I want to follow my desires, I want to follow my dreams, I want to fulfill my goals and ambitions, I don't want to have a ego death, Just want to be true to my self, And do things which give me Happiness .

These are the problems I have 

But recently the truth of uncertainty have struck me like lightning.

I have become more paranoid tham ever before.

I am afraid to love because I fear to losing them, but scares me more is the way I lose them because I have made a grave mistake of watching gore videos from a young age which made me scared of losing the things and people i would love especially, tragically.

There is a song lyrics which explains my situation.

""I feel so Disconnected from everyone, everyone around me. All i ever wanted was just to belong somewhere else than here""

I thought religion might be a way but Hinduism's main goal kinda goes against my own ways so I am in a place where I am confused if I should Worship God or Not.

And this have become so bad that I dropped the plan to stop smoking because it would help me Die faster because I have heard of that people who k!ll them selves have horrible consequences. Sometimes I feel like becoming a completely person but I don't want to it's like I am in the Edge of Insanity and I don't know what to do.

That's My Mental State.

Again another song comes in my mind which said

""Is Death the only Release?

Which for me means is it better to start again?

Quoting another song which actually explains my situation the best.

""My Lust for a new Beginning grows thick""

So, Is there any Solution for Me? Or I Should ""Live"" like this and Await My Death?

Karl doesn't know about any other religion except the religion he was born in. The ways of worshipping according to Karl's religion is to do regular prayers and rituals, and sacrifices of babies and animals in festivals. A person who has committed any crime like a murder shall be hung to death with intense pain and whosoever will persecute that criminal will be granted rewards by the god. 


Now, Karl has been conditioned to follow those morals and it's like quite a normal thing for him to do things that we consider harsh and heinous. He is not any kinda philosopher or a thinker, he is a potter who spends majority of his time in pottery and other time doing religious activities and spending time with family and friends.


Now the real question is, **""will he gain good karma or bad karma or something else""**? 

If he'll gain bad karma then he'll get more worse next life he's already into. Thus creating a never ending downstairs of getting worse lives.

It would be extremely rare for anyone like Karl to figure out that his religious guidelines doesn't works at all and are actually immoral.

V. Kane. At the end of a total of 6,358 pages across five volumes, the author has written an essay on what he considers the ""Fundamental Characteristics of Hindu Culture and Civilization"".  His list is as follows:

1) Though called by various names, God is One
2) Hinduism is tolerant of contrarian ideas
3) The self is non-different from the one Essence
4) There are the debts to Gods, Sages and Pitr
5) Four Purusharthas guide human pursuits
6) Society is classified into four Varnas
7) Life span is classified as four Ashramas
8) Karma and Punarjanma is believed by all
9) Ahimsa is a core value to be followed
10) Karma, Bhakti and Jnana are the three paths
11) Adhikari Bheda - spiritual gradation
12) Core is the vast Sanskrit Literature
13) Yoga as a physical practice
14) Philosophy of the six astika schools
15) Art, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting.

Well, I can see that some easy disagreements with this list maybe had in respect to points 3 and 11. It must also be said here that Kane himself comes with a strong bias towards Traditional Advaita. Point 1 may also be controversial in many regards.

I wonder what you guys think of this list. What would you want to add to it or rather remove from it? Any other comments you may have on it.

Now you can have your own opinion on the topic of Hindu gods being used as playable characters, but under my comment on that post there were many replies saying things like ""everything is brahman, the Gods are brahman, the characters (with the inappropriate designs) are also brahman, then why are you having a problem with it?""

I did not give a reply to them at that time but I randomly remembered that event today and decided to make this post for such lost souls with half baked knowledge of Advaita 

The amount of people that get into Advaita Vedanta and don't understand the difference between vyavahara and paramartha is hilarious 

They will hear things like ""there is nothing but God, you are God and the world is an illusion (and hence does not exist)"" from unauthorised (jholi wale babas) online who pose themselves as Advaita gurus and then they live in misunderstandings and misconceptions about Advaita and the world
 

There nothing but god(brahman), true

You are god(brahman), also true

But where? That is the question, you are brahman, but in paramartha, not in vyavahara 

Vyavahara is the truth that the jiva perceives under the influence of avidya(ignorance), this is the world that you and me see, feel and experience everyday, this is the world with the trees, the mountains and the oceans

Paramartha is the truth that remains when avidya is removed, this is the state of existance where there is nothing but brahman

Until the avidya is removed, you are in vyavahara, the things you see are true and distinct, in vyavahara there is dvaita(duality) everywhere and in everything, you are not your  father, delicious food on a plate and garbage on a plate is not the same thing

All of it becomes one, but where, in the state of paramartha not in the state of vyavahara 

Understand it like this, there is a very popular example used to explain Advaita

A man goes in a dark room and sees a snake on the ground, he turns on the light and find out that it was just a rope and he was perceiving it as a snake because of darkness 

Now if I ask you if the snake was true, you will probably say no, but if we go back to our example at the point where there was darkness infornt of the person, was the snake true to him then? Obviously the snake was true to him at that moment of time when there was darkness, when the darkness was removed only then the snake became false

Many people who learn advaita fail to realise that they are still the man standing in the darkness, they forget that they are still surrounded by avidya and till there is avidya the world is real, just like till there was darkness the snake was real

When avidya is removed (the light is turned on) only then the world will become false, and at that moment the person attains moksha

Just because you have learned a little about Advaita does not mean that your avidya is removed 



You cannot live according to the state of paramartha where everything is equal, it is not something you can follow, it is something that you have to achieve

For example 

The world is round, but can you act like if it was round?

You cannot, because you are too small and because of your small size the world will always appear flat to you and you will have to act like as if it is flat, you know it is round but you haven't realised it

Even if you want to act like if it was round you cannot because of your size, the ground under your feet will always appear flat to you and you will have to live like if it is flat

But yeah, while living in the flat world you can do one thing, you can make a spaceship, leave the earth, see it from the outside and realise its roundness

Similarly, everything is one(brahman) but you cannot act like as if everything is the same even if you want to, if you try to act like it that would also mean that food and feces should be the same to you and your wife and your mother should also be the same to you,

Try doing it, all you will achieve from it is being mentally ill

Till you live in vyavahara the world will always appear dual to you and you will have to live like the world is filled with dualities, due to avidya it will always appear like this 

Vyavahara is filled with dualities, it has good and bad, appropriate and inappropriate, dharma and adharma, you live in vyavahara and you will have to live according to vyavahara,

But one thing you can do while living in vyavahara is do bhkati, attain jnana and perform your karmas according to dharma, this way you can dissolve your ego and realise the oneness of brahman by attain moksha and being free from vyavahara by leaving it, like a spaceship leaving the earth and you being able to see the roundness of earth

Another thing is that in vyavahara due to it's dualities, you and ishvara are also not the same, there is a dvaita bhava (dual nature) between you and Vishnu/Shiva/Shakti, you are one with Vishnu/Shiva/Shakti only when you have reached paramartha ie attained moksha, it is through intense bhakti that you dissolve your ego and attain moksha, hence uniting with your ishta and becoming one with brahman

Knowing about brahman and realising it are two different things you will have to understand that, just like knowing the Earth is round and realising it's roundness by leaving it are two different things

Now is vyavahara an illusion?

No, it's just that your perspective is limited, the sun is round but from Earth it seems circular , is sun looking like a circle an illusion? No, it's just that your perspective is limited because of your distance from the sun 

Does it looking like a circle make it non existent, also no because if I was non existent how we would have been able to see it in the first place

Similarly the world is brahman, but it looks like the world because our perspective is limited by maya, it is not an illusion, nor is it non existent, it's just that it does not appear to us like how it really is because of our reduced perspectives, breaking free from maya and gaining the true perspective to see the reality as it is is liberation (moksha),

Like becoming bigger than the sun and seeing it's roundness 


Now coming at the beginning of the post, if someone makes an inappropriate, let's say pornographic imagery of Hindu Gods and Goddesses, it's not the same as a normal appropriate painting of Hindu deities 

Everything is brahman, but only when you have reached the paramartha, till you have avidya, you will be in vyavahara and you will have to live according to what is appropriate and oppose what is inappropriate 

Just assuming that everything is one is not removal of avidya, nor is it liberation

Removal of avidya comes through intense bhakti and meditation which leads to jnana, it does not come just by assuming things ",63,True,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy),,0.49,False,Hindū Darśana(s) (Philosophy)

Are you tired of non hindus especially muslims who try to undermine our dharma by saying that Lord Brahma married his daughter, Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvathy at the age of 8 and Lord Krishna married Goddess Rukmini at the age of 8 and other things. Here is a complete breakdown of debunking their claims. 

Lord Brahma married his daughter Goddess Sarasvati. If you go by that logic, according to the Quran, Adam was created from clay, and Eve was created from Adam (Surah An-Nisa (4:1)). That means eve was daughter of adam since allah created eve from adam and eve was adam's wife quran(2.35) that means its and incest so all the prophets who came from them are by products of incest

Lord Shiva married goddess Parvathy at the age of 8

Chapter 22 verse 52 or go to page no 558

it clearly says goddess Parvati did meditate for 3000 years before getting married to lord Shiva

so the claim that she married at the age of 8 is false

now Shri Krishna married Goddess Rukmini at the age of 16

Harivamsa purana Vishnu Parva chapter 59  verse 35

harivamsa purana is also purana about Lord Krishna

Now the claim Lord Ram married Goddess sita at the age of 6

If we assume that Goddess Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage, and considering that  Sita had three younger sisters—Urmila, Mandavi, and Shrutakirti—this would imply that Shrutakirti, being the youngest, was around 3 years old. Shrutakirti was married to Shatrughna during the same ceremony that united Rama with Sita, which means she would have been married at the age of 3. At that age, most children are not even capable of fully comprehending language or basic concepts, let alone the concept of marriage.Therefore, if we accept the premise that Sita was 6 years old at the time of her marriage, it would logically follow that Shrutakirti, who was the youngest princess, would have been younger than 6 years old when she got married, which is absurd. Additionally, considering that all four couples—Rama and Sita, Lakshmana and Urmila, Bharata and Mandavi, and Shatrughna and Shrutakirti—were married at the same time, it is highly improbable that Shrutakirti, at such a young age, would have been married alongside her older siblings. Even if it is true at the time of marriage Lord Ram was 12 years old so it is a child marriage and the responsibility is in the hands of their parents and not like your prophet who married aisha when he was 53 and she was 6

Here’s a breakdown of the timeline:

The Prophet was born in 570 CE, and he migrated to Medina in 622 CE at the age of 52.

He married Aisha shortly after the migration, in 623 CE, when he was about 53 years old.",16,True,Debunking misconceptions,,0.96,False,Debunking misconceptions

>The Rishis said, 'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.'""

>Sauti said, 'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three sena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a Vahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form a Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms, as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy.

According to Udyoga and Bhisma Parva the Pandavas and Kauravas have 7 and 11 Akshauhini sena, respectively. 

This gives us a total 18 Akshauhini which consists of

1,968,300 Infantry Soldiers

1,180,980 Cavalry Soldiers

787,320 Chariots (one driver one warrior) 

787,320 Elephants (one driver one warrior)

Total = 4,723,920 people

However even if there 4 people on an elephant or more, the maximum will still be 6 million or 7 million, reasonably.

I was unable to focus on daily tasks, and also felt like I was repeatedly feeling the craving for pornography, which I ended up not watching, though I did end up seeing content on Instagram that stimulated me to get rid of the repeated thoughts. This lasted for about 2 days to the point at which on day 6 during the night I ended up deciding to do it. I did not watch any pornography but it got hard to resist the urge, and as a result I felt bad. 

Before doing it I promised bagavam that I would after it restard not Masterbating for the rest of the time, and also cut out caffeine as a result of what I did.

Srunivasacharya was the disciple of Nimbarkacharya and one of the most prominent ācāryas in Nimbarka Sampradaya. His philosophical framework is known as Svābhāvika Bhedābheda. At the command of his preceptor, he wrote Vedanta-Kaustubha, which is more than a gloss on the Brahma-Sūtra-Bhāşya known as Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha of Nimbārkācārya, this fact is recorded by himself-
'तदाज्ञया तदुक्तवर्त्मना तदनुग्रहकामेन तच्छिष्येण मया मृदुमितपदो वेदान्तकौस्तुभस्त‌द्भावार्थप्रकाशको विदुषामुपकाराय विरच्यते।'

""At his command, I, his disciple desirous to win his favour, am composing Vedānta-Kaustubha, which is composed of soft and limited words and which express the purport of that (Vedānta Pārijāta Saurabha), which is in accordance with the way or path demonstrated by him, with a desire of obtaining his favour and for benefitting the wise.""

He is Pāñcajanya (Lord Visnu's conch) himself, as recorded by Śrī Puruṣottamācārya (4th acharya of the sampradayik lineage) stating that the Vedānta pārijāta saurabha was explained by Śrīnivāsa, who is the incarnation of Pāñcajanya, as revealed by the reverend preceptor Viśvācārya.

ETYMOLOGY
Svābhāvika Bhedābheda (also known as Dvaitādvaita and as Bhinnābhinna) is a sanskrit term that means natural relationship of differences and identity. 

﻿The term ""Svābhāvika"" signify the relationship is not brought about by any external agency, and therefore it cannot be dispensed with. An adventitious relation can be finished away by removing the cause or agency (upādhi) which has brought it, but what is natural cannot be taken away.

The term ""Bhedābheda"" represents the metaphysical relationship between the ultimate reality and other metaphysical entities. The literal translation of Bheda is differences and Abheda is identity. This relationship is characterized by simultaneous differences and non-differences. 


Ontology
Srinivasacharya’s philosophy, Svābhāvika Bhedābheda, articulates a threefold reality, distinguished as Brahman, Cit and Acit - ""तत्त्वं तावन्त्रिविधम्। चिदचिद्ब्रह्मभेदात्।""

Brahman: The metaphysical ultimate reality, object to be enquired into, and supreme controller.

Cit: The sentient individual soul (Jivātman), enquirer, enjoyer.

Acit: The non-sentient universe; the original cause of nescience, and the object to be enjoyed.
﻿ 
In this framework, Brahman is the only svatantra tattva (independent reality), while the existence and activities of the individual soul and the universe are dependent on Brahman, and are regarded as paratantra tattva (dependent reality) स्वाधीनपराधीनौ ब्रह्मजीवात्मानावित्यर्थः ॥
Individual soul and non-sentient universe are considered as a part of Brahman (aṃśā-aṃśī bhāva), using the part-whole analogy. However, this ""part"" should not be interpreted as a literal fragment, but rather as a manifestation of Brahman's power (śakti).

(“The end of light and darkness” meaning that awareness is the field in which all experiences of light, darkness, or anything else arise and dissolve)

That One is the Highest Divinity, the innate essence of all beings and states; for all that comes into being is nothing but the expression of its sovereign Power. || 2

(Through the power of Vimarsha all action and all phenomena is nothing but the direct expression of the power of consciousness. Since it cannot be limited whatsoever, and is the most fundamental reality, it must be necessity be the primal cause of all phenomena and experience)

The Goddess (Energy) never wants to be separate from the One who holds Her; they are eternally one Being — as inseparable as fire and its heat. || 3

(The Goddess is the representation of Para-Shakti, the absolute autonomous power of awareness(svatantrya) arising from Vimarsha. Bhairava represents the static and attributless aspect of awareness which is pure Prakasha. The innate power of Vimarsha is a potentiality “held within” Bhairava.)

(As such these are not at all two separate principles but just a way to describe the two most fundamental functions of awareness: that of illumination(Prakasha) and self-reflection (Vimarsha) )

That Lord is none other than Bhairava, whose role is to sustain (bhṛ) the world;
for through his Power, everything exists as a reflection in the mirror of the Self. || 4

(“In the mirror of the Self” means the world arises within awareness as a result of Vimarsha. He does not literally mean the Self is reflected in some external object like a mirror.)

That Supreme Goddess (Parā Devī) is none other than his longing to be intimately aware of his own nature, whose fullness & perfection in all beings is neither trifling nor significant. || 5

(This longing is a natural impulse arising spontaneously out of love, the impulse of awareness to be self-aware)

This God is eternally eager for the sweetness of love-play with this Goddess; [through it,] the Lord simultaneously accomplishes the wonderfully varied creations and dissolutions [of all the objects of our experience]. || 6

This Absolute [Consciousness] which accomplishes what seems impossible has autonomous sovereign awake awareness as its nature. || 7

It is said that the defining feature of insentience is a limited power of illumination; so Awareness is distinct from insentience by the fact that it is unlimited. || 8

(“Insentience” here refers to any limited powers of the Jiva such as the senses and mind. Awareness is distinct from these in the sense that it cannot be limited.)

(This should not be misunderstood as saying the Jiva is seperate from awareness, as I have talked about before the Jiva is a limited “contraction” of the uncontracted powers of awareness. Just because it is a contraction does not mean it exists as something other than the direct manifestation of consciousness.)

Thus, [the cycles of] creation and dissolution are innate [to Awareness], existing as subdivisions of its innate power of Freedom; as expressions of its true nature. || 9

For within these [cycles] there exist an infinite variety of painful and pleasurable worlds: higher, lower, and parallel [to this one] -- [all] aspects of this [unrestrained power of freedom to create]. || 10

The state of being ignorant of all this is itself a construct of that Freedom. The cyclical flux [of this autonomous Being] is indeed terrifying to those who are unconscious. || 11

(So even ignorance itself, like everything else, is a creation of Atma's freedom. What else could it possibly be?)

By what means [does one overcome ignorance]? Through His grace? Through the power of a mantra? Through the testimony of your guru? Or through the scriptures of the Supreme Lord? || 12

Recognition of the nature of reality is divine liberation. That state of fullness experienced by the awakened ones is taught to be jīvanmukti (living liberation). || 13

(As Abhinava tells us plainly: “In our way, the ultimate goal is simply recognition of one’s own fundamental nature. That is what is most worth seeking in this world.”)

(Commentator adds: Liberation is the manifestation of one’s innate freedom, bursting with wonder at the experience of the sense of ‘I’ encompassing everything, i.e. recognition of the nature of reality as unsurpassed consciousness.)

These two states — bondage and liberation — both derive from the nature of the Highest Divinity; they are indivisible — one implies the other — for there can in reality be no division within the Highest Divinity. || 14

Thus one should cultivate & cherish Bhairava, dwelling within the trident-and-lotus-throne whose prongs are the powers of Willing, Knowing, and Acting. || 15

(Cultivating Bhairava means, utilizing any of the 4 upayas, a Jiva comes to recognize and experience the vast fullness of consciousness which is called Bhairava)

I thought I can leave a couple to grow and eat the rest, but it feels weird since I helped them come out of their seed. Why would I start their life just to kill them? I would like some other Hindu perspective on this. Shouldn't I uphold ahimsa and refrain from eating the sprouts?

I am doing a research project into the lives of childfree (CF) and antinatalist (AN) women of color. To start off, I am asking for participation from everyone in the broader CF and AN communities, to get a baseline on shared experiences and perspectives.

Being childfree is seen as a personal choice not to have children, whereas antinatalism is an ethical principle that it is immoral to have children.

My research question is: What specific challenges, including cultural stigma, familial pressure, religious beliefs, and economic expectations, do childfree and antinatalist women of color face in pronatalist communities?

I have a scholarly reviewed and approved survey to share. It should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, and the answers are anonymous. If you would like to participate further, there is an option to share your email address. It is not a requirement.

This is specifically for those who identify as CF or AN.

Thank you for your participation!

Secondly, modern Hindu astrology is heavily influenced by Greek and Persian astrology practices, with medieval scholars writing commentaries on some Greek astrological works (like Pauline Bhasya, etc.). as well.

>There is a great discussion going on as to whether the aggregate of materials we call the body is the cause of manifestation of the force we call the soul, thought, etc., or whether it is the thought that manifests this body.

Then:

>There are schools of modern thought which hold that what we call thought is simply the outcome of the adjustment of the parts of the machine which we call body.

Swami Vivekananda rejects this notion by saying:

>To say that the force called soul is the outcome of the combinations of the molecules of the body is putting the cart before the horse. How did the combinations come; where was the force to make them? If you say that some other force was the cause of these combinations, and soul was the outcome of that matter, and that soul — which combined a certain mass of matter — was itself the result of the combinations, it is no answer.

This is later followed by:

>To say, therefore, that the thought forces manifested by the body are the outcome of the arrangement of molecules and have no independent existence has no meaning; neither can force evolve out of matter.

**My question: At first it** ***may*** **seem to make sense to you, but isn't this exactly what happened? Coincidences, which lead to life. He doesn't even take this into account, probably because it leaves it the question unanswered, but that is the point, it IS unanswered. We still do not know it for sure.**

**He seems to be forcefully painting the situation into a corner, narrowing it down a bit too much.**

**Does it mean something else or am I missing something?**
